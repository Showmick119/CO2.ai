He is selling \"$10B worth of shares\" was news already. It's not news anymore.  It's also concerning how little some of y'all get how this works. I'll clarify. Musk is an insider at Tesla. He made the decision to sell these shares months ago. There are rules in place to stop market timing and they work like this: if Mr. CEO wants to sell shares (for whatever reasons... taxes, doubt, etc) he enters his trades months in advance. He can only sell once a quarter.  When the trade actually goes through, it is \"VWAP'd\". (Volume Weighted Average Price) Split up, because unless we're talking penny stocks, walking up and entering a trade for 5 million shares is going cause a price change. There just isn't enough instantaneous volume on the market to absorb that volume without a major price change, especially not for $1,200 per share Tesla.  In Musk's case, this is a multi-day VWAP, since there are literally SO MANY shares being sold. His broker is selling 100 share bunches ALL DAY and giving him the average price at the end of the day when it's all added up.  So this isn't me being a Tesla bear, but the lack of price collapse is not a sign of anything. It's the system doing what it's literally designed to. The price only dropped because OTHER sells drove it down on the news.

So\u2026 VW isn\u2019t even trying to catch up to Tesla because it can\u2019t. Tesla is continuing to innovate at a pace a company like VW is not capable of doing.

I just don't see where that growth is supposed to come from. It isn't as though most current major automakers aren't still going to be major players in fifteen years. And if they aren't, it's far more likely it's because they don't survive Apple's market disruption when that happens, not because Tesla has a flamboyant CEO.   From where I'm sitting, Tesla already has more competition than they can handle with Ford. The EV market isn't being ceded to Tesla, despite that having been priced in. Ford is swimming in preorders for their F150 Lightning. Cybertruck is way behind, at risk of cancellation. Reviewers like the Mustang Mach-E. *Motor Trend* like it almost as well as Tesla Model Y, and *Car and Driver* like it better.  GM, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, VW, BMW, and Kia are probably all planning on playing in the space, among others.  I understand Tesla's value (or lack thereof). What I don't understand is its price.

Here\u2019s my analysis on chipotle:    1.\t\u20602600 stores currently with a plan to reach 6000 stores with growing AUV from 2 million to 3.5 million long term by 2030. Almost all of the stores are in the United States with a few in Canada and even less in the UK so international expansion is still wide open for them. On their latest call, Niccol said that they are still testing the European market but signs are looking good for further expansion into the EU (mostly the UK and France for now).  2.\t\u2060Piper Sandler came out with a teen survey that said Chipotle was one of the restaurants they would choose the most, alongside Chick Fil A and Starbucks. The majority of Chipotles customers are under 34 and an even greater amount under 24. Their customers are expected to provide a greater lifetime value than other competitors with aging clientele. Young customers also prefer to pay for healthier, quality food versus overly processed foods.  3.\t\u2060The switch to digital as well as the addition of drive thrus boosts profit margin. Mobile ordering also helps stay connected with the younger customers along with data collection  to know the customer better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dip a toe into dark or ghost kitchens to move into areas where the financials of spending a 1-2 million dollars for a physical store don\u2019t make sense. These dark or ghost kitchens will have huge margins. 4.\t\u2060Great management, great financials, no long term debt. Enough cash to pay off any remaining debt. FCF increasing. The physical stores typically pay for themselves around a year and a half. It isn\u2019t a franchise so they keep 100% of the 25% profit margin.  5.\t\u2060Moat. Very few people realize or believe their moat because after all they just make burritos. But McDonald\u2019s just does burgers, Starbucks just makes coffee and dominoes just does pizza. IMO and Morningstar\u2019s opinion they have a wide moat. I believe their moat comes in the form of brand value and pricing power. The chipotle brand is synonymous with quality, similar to Apple. When Apple has a product with a glitch or defect it makes the news where as other brands don\u2019t. When chipotle came out with the original Queso dip people didn\u2019t like it and it made the news. Mis steps for this company are few and far between with the quality of their food (here your probably thinking the food illness problem from a few years ago, I\u2019ll address that below). Because of the brand value, Inflation and price hikes don\u2019t affect the customer loyalty as customers are willing to pay for quality. When they added Carne Asada, they increased the price .25 cents and saw \u201cno degradation\u201d in demand \u201cat all.\u201d Price increases may affect McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and other competitors more as their entire business model is to provide as much cheap food for the lowest cost. Well that cost is crawling up with inflation so the value isn\u2019t as great as it once was. Along with the brand value created pricing power. Pricing power in rising prices without affecting demand but also in the price of the store locations. Strip mall and mall owners often give chipotle a deal on the lease or rent because they know chipotle will drive foot traffic which may help other businesses. A new store typically pays for itself in about a year and a half.  6.   The food poisoning issue seems to be behind them. Almost all large food chains have had their share of food poisoning issues (KFC, Jack in the box, Burger King and more) yet they\u2019re all still around. Chipotles was three years ago, which led to a new CEO with Brian Niccol who came from Taco Bell and is used to running large food chains and has since cleaned up the food illness problems. Long story short, I listened to a podcast with Steve Ells (the founder) where he explained that they disinfect every single item on the menu before it even gets to the store. For example, they boil avocados for 4 seconds to completely kill germs on the outside AND the inside which doesn\u2019t affect flavor (which is new from what they were doing).  7. They basically invented the fast casual form of restaurant. When a new company tries their business model it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe chipotle of\u2026\u201d   Risks that I see (I may miss something but I don\u2019t trust DD without any risks listed)  1.\t\u2060Like Apple\u2019s insistent demand of quality, any food illness problems will hurt their brand value more than others. Food illness is a risk for any restaurant but I believe the news is much more likely to make a big deal about chipotle\u2019s problems than a Taco Bell or other company because they commit themselves to quality. This will in turn crush chipotles brand loyalty. 2.\t\u2060The drive thrus are capital intensive and they haven\u2019t been proven to be successful yet. 3.\t\u2060The demand for superior ingredients are subject to hired risk from the suppliers prices. 4.\t\u2060Competition from other quick service restaurants. 5. The valuation is a lot higher than other restaurants but it\u2019s finding support around the 1790s range.    Obviously I\u2019m very bullish in chipotle. I think it\u2019s a great long term investment. I think a lot of people over look them because the business model is so simple but then again, so is Coca Cola\u2019s. It\u2019s also a lot sexier to tech.   When it comes to Portillo\u2019s, I love it. I grew up on it and in fact I\u2019m having it tonight. I got it shipped to my house since I don\u2019t live by one anymore. My main concern is whether they can teach people what Italian Beef sandwiches are since most people have never heard of it. I just think the upside of chipotle is greater than Portillo\u2019s.](/r/stocks/comments/qr3pha/your_favorite_restaurant_stocks/hk556ax/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 00:49:56 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[The CEO should start tweeting shit like \"Feelin' cute, might sell the company to Saudi Arabia later\" to get more news attention.](/r/stocks/comments/qqyg1b/rivian_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/hk61q4n/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 05:07:11 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Apart form Tsla, what other exclusively-battery-car companies have IPOed?

Introduction to Aptiv PLC and Its Role in the Automotive Technology Landscape\n\nAptiv PLC is a large global automotive technology supplier headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The company designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of advanced vehicle components, integrated systems, and software solutions for major automakers worldwide.\n\nAptiv's key product areas include advanced safety technologies, autonomous driving systems, connected services, data management platforms, and vehicle electrification solutions. The company also has a significant presence in the aerospace and defense industries through its subsidiary, Wind River Systems, which provides software and services for mission-critical intelligent systems.\n\nAptiv's customer base includes most of the world's leading automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and many others. In addition, through its Wind River subsidiary, Aptiv serves as a contractor for various government and military agencies, providing software and services for aerospace, defense, and other critical infrastructure applications.\n\nThe company has a strong global presence, with a workforce of over 200,000 employees across 120+ manufacturing facilities and 12 major technical centers in 44 countries. Notably, Aptiv operates a significant data center in China, which has raised concerns among some cybersecurity experts and policymakers about the potential for data privacy and national security risks.\n\nIn terms of market size, Aptiv is a significant player in the automotive technology industry. In 2020, the company reported net sales of $13.1 billion, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aptiv's market capitalization as of April 2023 stands at approximately $28 billion, reflecting its substantial market value and industry position. The company's Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, which includes many of the data-driven technologies discussed in this document, accounted for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2020, demonstrating the significant scale of these systems in modern vehicles.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, autonomous, and data-driven, Aptiv's role in the automotive technology landscape continues to grow. The company's vast array of sensors, software platforms, and data management systems are becoming increasingly central to the operation of modern vehicles, raising important questions about data privacy, security, and potential misuse that will be explored further in this document.\n\nHowever, Aptiv's involvement in government contracting and its operation of a data center in China add additional layers of complexity and concern to these issues. The company's access to sensitive government and military data through its Wind River subsidiary, as well as the potential for data hosted in its Chinese data center to be accessed by foreign actors, raise serious questions about the company's data practices and the adequacy of its security measures.\n\nThese concerns are particularly acute given the increasing importance of connected vehicle data for national security, critical infrastructure, and personal privacy. As policymakers and regulators grapple with the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of automotive technology, it is essential that the roles and practices of key industry players like Aptiv be subject to rigorous scrutiny and oversight.\n\nIn the following sections, this document will delve into the specific risks and concerns associated with Aptiv's data collection practices, as well as the broader implications of connected vehicle technology for personal privacy, public safety, and national security. By examining these issues in depth, we hope to contribute to a more informed and robust public dialogue about the future of automotive technology and the steps needed to ensure that its benefits are realized while its risks are effectively mitigated.\n\n1. Sensors, Systems, and Data Collection in Aptiv-Equipped Vehicles\n\nModern vehicles, especially those equipped with Aptiv's advanced technologies, contain a wide array of sensors, systems, and components that collect vast amounts of data and control various vehicle functions. These components are essential for enabling features like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, connected services, and vehicle safety enhancements. However, they also raise important privacy, security, and safety concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data they collect and the control they have over the vehicle.\n\nSome of the key sensors, systems, and data collection components found in Aptiv-equipped vehicles include:\n\n* GPS (Global Positioning System): GPS sensors track the precise location of the vehicle at all times, generating a detailed record of the vehicle's movements and routes.\n* Cameras: Modern vehicles often include multiple cameras, both inside and outside the cabin. These cameras can capture video and images of the vehicle's surroundings, as well as the occupants inside the vehicle.\n* Radar and Lidar: Radar and lidar sensors use radio waves and laser light, respectively, to detect objects and obstacles around the vehicle. They generate detailed 3D maps of the vehicle's environment and are critical for ADAS and autonomous driving features.\n* Accelerometers and Gyroscopes: These sensors measure the vehicle's acceleration, braking, and turning movements. They provide data on the vehicle's motion and driving dynamics.\n* Biometric Sensors: Some advanced vehicle systems include biometric sensors that can monitor the driver's attention level, eye movements, heart rate, and other physiological parameters.\n* Microphones: Many vehicles include microphones for voice commands, hands-free calling, and in-cabin noise cancellation.

Bad actors could potentially hack into vehicle camera systems to spy on occupants in compromising situations or even record and distribute intimate footage without consent.\n* Surveillance and Monitoring: Remote viewing capabilities could be exploited by governments, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies to conduct invasive surveillance and monitoring of targeted individuals or groups. This could have chilling effects on freedom of speech, association, and political dissent.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to vehicle camera systems. This should include strong encryption, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for clear regulations and guidelines around the use of in-cabin cameras and remote viewing capabilities. This should include strict limits on when and how these features can be used, mandatory disclosure to vehicle occupants when they are being recorded, and robust protections against misuse by law enforcement or government agencies.\n\nConsumers should also be empowered with meaningful control over the cameras and imaging sensors in their vehicles, including the ability to physically disable or cover these components when not in use.\n\nUltimately, while remote viewing capabilities may offer some benefits in terms of safety and convenience, the risks to individual privacy and security are significant. As such, the development and deployment of these technologies must be approached with the utmost caution and transparency, and with the rights and interests of consumers as the top priority.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any of these points or if you have any other suggestions for this section on remote viewing risks. I'm happy to refine the content to ensure it comprehensively addresses the key concerns.\n\n1. Remote Communication\n\nAnother significant risk associated with connected vehicle systems is the ability for remote communication and interaction with a vehicle's internal components and control systems. This includes the capability to update firmware, modify software settings, and even directly control physical actuators like brakes, throttle, and steering.\n\nThese remote communication channels present a wide array of potential attack vectors and misuse cases:\n\n* Malicious Firmware Updates: By compromising the firmware update process, a hacker could potentially install malicious code onto a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs). This could allow them to manipulate vehicle behavior, disable safety features, or even take complete control of the vehicle remotely. Such attacks could be carried out at scale, targeting entire fleets of vehicles simultaneously.\n* Disabling Safety Systems: Hackers could exploit remote communication vulnerabilities to disable critical safety systems like airbags, anti-lock brakes, or electronic stability control. This could be done for malicious purposes, such as causing accidents or facilitating other crimes, or as part of a larger terrorist attack or act of cyberwarfare.\n* Targeted Attacks and Assassinations: The ability to remotely control a vehicle's acceleration, braking, and steering could enable terrifyingly precise targeted attacks. Hackers could potentially cause a specific vehicle to crash, allowing for nearly untraceable assassinations or \"accidental\" deaths.\n* Ransomware and Extortion: By gaining remote control over a vehicle's systems, hackers could effectively hold the vehicle and its occupants hostage. They could demand a ransom payment in exchange for releasing control of the vehicle, or threaten to cause an accident if their demands are not met. This could be particularly effective against fleet vehicles or those belonging to high-value targets.\n* Bot Networks and Distributed Attacks: Compromised vehicles could be used as part of a larger botnet or distributed attack network. Hackers could harness the collective computing power and connectivity of many vehicles to conduct large-scale denial-of-service attacks, mine cryptocurrencies, or spread malware to other connected systems.\n* Theft and Hijacking: Hackers could exploit remote communication channels to unlock and start vehicles remotely, enabling sophisticated theft schemes. They could also potentially hijack vehicles in motion, taking control away from the driver and rerouting the vehicle to a desired location.\n* Privacy Breaches: By accessing a vehicle's communication systems, hackers could potentially intercept sensitive data transmissions, including personal information, location data, and even audio from in-cabin microphones. This could enable identity theft, stalking, or other privacy breaches.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with remote communication are not just theoretical. In a deeply concerning incident, it was revealed that private keys used to secure vehicle communication systems were leaked online. These keys, if obtained by malicious actors, could potentially grant unauthorized access to thousands of vehicles, enabling the kinds of attacks and misuse cases described above.\n\nThe leak of these private keys underscores the urgent need for more robust cybersecurity measures and more transparent disclosure of potential vulnerabilities by automotive technology suppliers. It also raises serious questions about the industry's ability to safeguard the integrity of vehicle systems and protect consumers from cyber threats.\n\nThe risks posed by remote communication vulnerabilities, combined with the demonstrated reality of critical security failures like the leaked private keys, present a grave threat to public safety and national security.

This information could be exploited for targeted propaganda, manipulation, or blackmail, enabling sophisticated psychological operations at scale. Moreover, in a disturbing scenario, a malicious actor could potentially use a vehicle's sensors and control systems to actively manipulate the driving experience, causing intentional distress or even fear in targeted individuals. For example, by subtly altering the vehicle's handling, braking, or acceleration, an attacker could create a sense of unease or anxiety in the driver, making them more susceptible to manipulation or coercion. In more extreme cases, an attacker could potentially use a vehicle's systems to create overtly frightening or dangerous situations, such as causing sudden, unexpected braking or swerving, or even staging apparent near-misses or collisions. By inducing a state of heightened stress and fear, an attacker could potentially influence a targeted individual's behavior, decision-making, or even mental health over time. The use of connected vehicles as a tool for psychological manipulation represents a chilling evolution of traditional PSYOPs tactics, enabling a level of targeted, personalized, and persistent influence that has never before been possible. The implications of this for personal autonomy, mental well-being, and even political stability are deeply concerning.\n* Fingerprinting Nearby Devices: A vehicle's wireless communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, could be used to scan for and fingerprint nearby electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices. This could allow for the tracking and identification of individuals based on their digital footprint, even if they are not directly connected to the vehicle.\n* Health Data Exploitation: Some vehicles are equipped with biometric sensors that can monitor a driver's heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological parameters. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this data could be used to infer sensitive health information about individuals, enabling targeted advertising, insurance discrimination, or even blackmail.\n* IoT Device Hacking: A vehicle's sensors could potentially be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in nearby IoT devices, such as smart home appliances, wearables, or industrial control systems. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to these devices, steal sensitive data, or even cause physical harm.\n* Situational Awareness and Control: By aggregating data from multiple vehicles' sensors, malicious actors could gain a highly detailed and real-time understanding of traffic patterns, crowd movements, and other environmental factors. This situational awareness could be used to coordinate terrorist attacks, disrupt emergency response efforts, or even control the flow of people and goods in a given area.\n\nThe risks associated with remote sensing are particularly concerning given the increasing sophistication and range of sensors being integrated into modern vehicles. As autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, the amount and granularity of data collected by these sensors will only continue to grow, amplifying the potential for misuse and abuse.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers and manufacturers implement robust data security and privacy safeguards. This should include strict access controls, encryption of sensor data both at rest and in transit, and secure over-the-air update mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to sensor firmware.\n\nThere is also a need for clear regulatory guidelines and oversight regarding the collection, use, and sharing of vehicle sensor data. Consumers should be given transparent notice of what data is being collected by their vehicles, and have the ability to opt-out of data collection for non-essential functions.\n\nFrom a national security perspective, the risks posed by remote sensing underscore the need for proactive engagement and collaboration between the automotive industry, cybersecurity researchers, and government agencies. This should include the development of robust threat intelligence sharing mechanisms, as well as joint efforts to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities in vehicle sensor systems.\n\nUltimately, the remote sensing capabilities of connected vehicles present both immense opportunities and significant risks. Realizing the benefits of these technologies while mitigating their potential for harm will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, guided by a shared commitment to security, privacy, and the public good.\n\nAs we continue to navigate this complex and rapidly evolving landscape, it is crucial that we remain vigilant to the risks posed by remote sensing and other emerging automotive technologies.

EV APP OF THE WEEK:\u00a0CONNECTED KERB\n\nProbably the UK\u2019s favourite charging app. We heard that electric vehicle drivers (that's you) hate charging apps because they\u2019re not very user friendly and there\u2019s too many to choose from. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built a charging app that you can rely on, day in day out. Welcome to the world of Connected Kerb.\n\n[Download Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.connectedkerb.cp.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US)\n\n## 2. EV\u00a0NEWS:\u00a0THE DRIVEN\n\nBreakthrough EV battery pack could last 2 million kms, or 130 years of average driving. Chinese manufacturer Gotion High-Tech has announced a new battery pack will go into mass production in 2024 that it says will deliver range of up to 1,000kms for a single charge and could last two million kms.The company says the manganese doped L600 LMFP Astroinno will be able to do 4,000 full cycles at room temperature, and at high temperature will get 1800 cycles and over 1500 cycles of 18-minute fast charging.\n\n## 3. EV TIP:\u00a0USING THE RIGHT CAR MODE\n\nSaving: Increase your range by 5% Many newer vehicles offer a range of driving modes, allowing you to pick the driving mode that best suits your environment, driving conditions, and mood. However, driving modes can have a big impact on the fuel consumption of your vehicle, ultimately costing you more in charging costs.\n\nTo keep your EV costs down, avoid driving modes like sport and 4 wheel drive. Instead, it\u2019s estimated that you could boost your range on a single charge by about 5% by opting for an eco mode. Eco mode sends power back to your car battery when you break as well as regulating other fuel consuming aspects of driving (like your air con).\n\nMany newer vehicles offer a range of driving modes, allowing you to pick the driving mode that best suits your environment, driving conditions, and mood.

As the world becomes more conscious about the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, electric cars are quickly gaining popularity as a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation.In this video, we explore why electric cars are becoming more popular by the day, and the benefits they offer over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. We'll look at the technology behind electric cars and how it's improving, making them more efficient, affordable, and convenient for everyday use.\n\n## 5. EV REVIEW: WHAT CAR?\n\n*BMW i4*\n\nThinking about going electric but don\u2019t want to shout it from the rooftops? Well, the BMW i4 could be the car for you. While BMW\u2019s first electric car \u2013 the outlandish-looking BMW i3 \u2013 was designed from the ground up to run on electricity, the i4 looks like what it essentially is: an electric version of the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe.\n\nAs far as we\u2019re concerned, that close relationship is a very good thing indeed. The BMW 4 Series and the car it's based on, the BMW 3 Series saloon, sit at the top of their respective classes.\n\nUntil next time. Have a fantastic week!\n\n***EV Cables Team***\n\n**ENJOYING EV TUESDAYS?

AUGUST 13TH 2029\n\nBrazil's rise over the past few years is nothing short of impressive. The country has made remarkable strides in its economic sphere, and its potential for greatness is evident. Brazil has already surpassed the 3 trillion GDP mark this year, a significant milestone that reinforces its status as a potential economic powerhouse and a major player in the global community.\n\nWhile there is still a little way to go, we know exactly what steps are needed to attain the final push. The best part is that it doesn't have to be a costly venture. Brazil has a wealth of resources, along with the talent, determination, and a plethora of opportunities arising from the ongoing nuclear war and the current crisis worldwide. By leveraging these opportunities, Brazil can bring its vision to fruition and establish itself as a leading force on the global stage, while laying the groundwork for a bright future in 2030 and beyond.\n\nNow is the time for Brazil to seize the moment and take center stage, showcasing its full potential. The Brazilian government has announced ambitious measures to take advantage of the current global situation, with one of them being a measure that a certain world power has done in the past and worked fantastically. This demonstrates the government's commitment to progress and development, which will pave the way for Brazil's growth and success.\n\n**EXPORT MODEL**\nBrazil has long been criticized for its export model, which has been heavily reliant on basic and semi-manufactured products. Over-reliance on such exports has been a major obstacle to the country's long-term economic growth as it generates little monetary value.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to this problem, including the lack of infrastructure, bad logistics, excessive bureaucracy, high energy prices, and the lack of clear industrial policy. However, in recent years, Brazil has made significant progress in addressing these challenges. The country has increased production of energy, invested in improving infrastructure, implemented tax reforms, and made improvements to logistics, all of which have helped Brazil diversify its exports.\n\nTo encourage more Brazilian exportation and business, Brazil can significantly benefit from supporting its export activities, particularly by increasing resources to facilitate smaller companies' access to credit lines provided by the BNDES-Exim and the Export Financing Program (Proex). Sectors with greater production chains, exporting capacity, and growth are more likely to benefit from this initiative. Doubling the number of SMEs receiving credit from BNDES-Exim and Proex within the next five years would be a target. Annual targets will be set for the number of SMEs receiving credit and tracking progress towards these targets on a regular basis. It will also be essential to establish objective criteria for defining the budget resources allocated to the program to increase not only the availability but also the predictability of resources. The government will develop a set of metrics to evaluate the program's effectiveness and determine the level of funding required to achieve its goals. Establishing these criteria could ensure that the program is operating efficiently and effectively and that resources are being allocated in a way that supports the most impactful projects.\n\nTo facilitate access to the FGE fund (Fundo de Garantia \u00e0 Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o) and increase the volume of exports covered by Export Credit Insurance, the Brazilian government will simplify and streamline the application process for accessing the fund, create a single portal for applications, and simplify the required documentation. The FGE's fund will also be given more financing from the government, and the application process will be streamlined by reviewing the procedures of the Cofig and reducing the average time for analysis and approval of the FGE and Proex pleas.\n\nAlthough Brazil has a well-established and equipped export promotion structure, there is a lack of coordination among the different government agencies engaged in trade promotion activities, and there is no clear integration between export promotion and trade policy as a whole. To address this, a Trade Promotion Action Plan will be developed, starting with the Strategic Plan of Apex-Brazil, with the involvement and contribution of MRE, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Ipea, and other bodies directly interested in foreign trade. The plan will include the formation of a Brazilian Export Promotion Council (BEPC) responsible for overseeing and coordinating all trade promotion activities and ensuring greater collaboration and integration between different government agencies. The BEPC would be tasked with evaluating and proposing policies to improve Brazilian exports and would establish a mechanism for regular consultation with businesses and industry groups to ensure that their needs and priorities are being taken into account.\n\nThe Brazilian government's efforts to diversify exports and address the factors contributing to over-reliance on basic and semi-manufactured products will help increase the competitiveness of Brazilian businesses and make it easier for them to access global markets. Encouraging Brazilian exportation and business is critical to succeeding on the international scale and increasing profits.\n\n**SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES, A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.**\nAfter China's involvement in a devastating, but thankfully contained nuclear war, investors around the world have become increasingly concerned and panicked about the security and stability of their investments, and are looking for safe and promising nations to invest in. Some investors have already started to shift their focus towards Brazil, which presents a unique opportunity for the country to strengthen its economy.\n\nBrazil has made significant progress in recent years in developing its business environment, reducing bureaucracy significantly, and improving its infrastructure, which has helped to attract investment and support economic growth. The country also has abundant natural resources, which could be used to support the growth of new industries. In the wake of the Sino-Russian War, Brazil now has the potential to become the new factory of the world, following in the footsteps of China. With a rapidly growing economy that has reached 3 trillion this year, a large and still growing middle class, a cheap and experienced workforce, growing economic reforms, and other advantages, Brazil presents a unique and rare opportunity for the country to prosper on a global scale.\n\nTo achieve this, Brazil needs to attract more investors and businesses to the nation. This is where SEZs come in. Special Economic Zones have been proven to be an effective tool to attract foreign investment and foster economic growth. China has used this strategy to great success, allowing the creation of areas where regulations are different from the rest of the country, making them centers of high productivity production. Other countries such as Paraguay have implemented similar strategies, such as the maquila system which exempts companies that produce there exclusively for export purposes from taxation. These initiatives have led to significant economic growth in those countries.\n\nIn the case of Brazil, the creation of special zones where companies could work without receiving at least part of the immense weight that the legislation places on production could serve as a testing ground where different models of regulation could be implemented and compared. The best ones could be replicated or scaled up, while the worst could be discarded.\n\nThe Brazilian Congress has accepted a law today, putting into existence the first SEZs in Brazil. There are extremely high hopes for those SEZs, and even if they don't turn out as expected, this is a measure with low risks but extremely high rewards.\n\nThe benefits of SEZs areas include special tax incentives for foreign investments in the SEZs, such as much lower taxes on companies and businesses, which can make them more attractive to investors. Greater independence from the central government on international trade activities is also provided, causing international economic cooperation and technology exchange. with more relaxed regulations to facilitate business. SEZs are listed separately in the national planning, including financial planning, and have province-level authority on economic administration. SEZs local congress and local government have the authority to legislate, providing them with more control and flexibility in shaping their own economic policies.\n\nThe Brazilian Government has carefully analyzed multiple cities in it's territories to be the ones to spearhead this new economic measure.\n\n>Southeast<\nS\u00e3o Paulo SP:\nS\u00e3o Paulo, the economic and financial heart of Brazil, has all the necessary characteristics to become a successful Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The city's diverse economy, developed infrastructure, and strategic location make it a highly attractive destination for foreign investors. Given its status as a major trade hub, a modified Free Trade Zone SEZ system will be implemented in the city to capitalize on its industries and facilities, and encourage duty-free import and export of goods, thus stimulating trade and economic growth. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo's thriving service sector, including finance, technology, and healthcare, is ideal for an SEZ. By attracting companies and investors from around the world to establish operations in S\u00e3o Paulo, this SEZ could generate highly-skilled jobs and enhance the city's competitiveness in the global services market. Furthermore, S\u00e3o Paulo's geographic characteristics, including its extensive road and rail networks, international airport, and proximity to major economic centers in South America, make it a great location for improving logistics and supply chain management. This would attract logistics and transportation companies to invest in S\u00e3o Paulo and improve the city's competitiveness in the logistics sector. In summary, S\u00e3o Paulo's unique economic and geographic characteristics make it a prime candidate for SEZ designation. By attracting foreign investment and promoting job creation, an SEZ in S\u00e3o Paulo could further strengthen the city's economy and position it as a global economic hub.\n\nSantos SP:\nSantos is home to Latin America's busiest port, handling a significant volume of trade and serving as a gateway to South America. An SEZ in Santos would be extremely beneficial to logistics and trade, attracting companies involved in the export and import of goods, providing support for logistics and supply chain management, and facilitating trade with other countries. The SEZ would also focus on promoting the development of high-tech logistics and transportation solutions, leveraging the presence of world-class infrastructure. As the largest port in South America, Santos is a strategic hub for international trade and a gateway to Brazil's economic powerhouse. Its port is responsible for a significant proportion of Brazil's exports and imports, and it also plays a significant role in the transportation of other goods, such as grains, oil, and cars. As an SEZ, Santos will attract more foreign investment, stimulate local businesses, and create job opportunities. The Santos SEZ will be quite beneficial to the nation, and it will be able to collaborate closely and grow richer with SP, as approximately 90% of S\u00e3o Paulo's industrial base is located less than 200 miles from the port of Santos.\n\nVitoria ES:\nVitoria, ES, Brazil, is a promising region to become a profitable Special Economic Zone (SEZ) due to its unique economic and geographic characteristics. Located in the southeast of Brazil, Vitoria is a major port city that serves as a gateway for imports and exports to and from the region, with two major ports. Its strategic location on the coast, in the center of the Southeast Region, offers easy access to major markets and transportation routes, making it a vital hub for the country's economy. As an SEZ, Vitoria could leverage its location to boost its logistics and transportation industries, attract new investment, and foster innovation. Moreover, Vitoria is a center for the mining and processing of iron ore, with many of the country's largest mining companies headquartered in the region, such as Vale. The city is also a key producer of steel, with the Companhia Siderurgica de Tubarao (CST) steel plant located there. These industries are crucial to Brazil's economy and would benefit greatly from the streamlined regulations and tax incentives offered by an SEZ.\n\nNiteroi RJ:\nNiteroi is a fast-growing city located just across the bay from Rio de Janeiro. The city is known for its beautiful beaches, historic architecture, and strong tourism industry. In recent years, Niteroi has also become a center for technology and innovation, with companies such as IBM and Siemens having research and development facilities in the city. As an SEZ, Niteroi could attract even more visitors and investment in the tourism sector. The city could also benefit from increased investment in infrastructure and transportation, such as a possible high-speed train connecting Niteroi to Rio. Additionally, Niteroi's proximity to Rio De Janeiro's port provides access to a vast market for goods and services. Moreover, Niteroi is home to several top-ranked universities and research centers, providing a rich source of talent and innovation for businesses. These institutions are helping to drive the city's growing technology sector, which has the potential to become a significant contributor to the local economy within an SEZ environment. Overall, Niteroi's combination of a strategic location, diverse economy, strong educational and research institutions, and growing technology and naval industries make it an ideal candidate for SEZ designation. By attracting new investment, streamlining regulations, and fostering innovation, an SEZ could help unlock Niteroi's full economic and technological potential and bring new prosperity to the region.\n\n\n\n>Northeast<\nPecem CE:\nPecem, CE is a city located in the northeast region of Brazil, in the state of Ceara. Although it can be considered small, it has experienced an economic boom thanks to the development of a Green Hydrogen and Renewable Energy industry in the state and city. With its growth, Pecem is on its way to becoming an important city in the country. It is home to one of Brazil's largest ports and an industrial complex that includes a steel mill and a thermoelectric plant. The port handles more than 19 million tons of cargo annually, including steel, iron ore, and cement. The industrial complex, known as the Pecem Industrial and Port Complex, is a major source of employment and economic growth in the region. As an SEZ, Pecem will attract more investment in these industries and become a major hub within the region and nation, attracting even more companies to the city.\n\nFortaleza CE:\nFortaleza, the capital of the state of Cear\u00e1 in northeastern Brazil, is a prime city to become a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). This bustling city of over 3.2 million people boasts a diverse economy with strengths in tourism, manufacturing, and services. As a coastal city, Fortaleza is strategically located for trade and commerce, with its bustling port serving as a major gateway for imports and exports. Considered the second richest city in all of the northeast region, the SEZ designation could encourage companies to set up shop in Fortaleza, bringing with them new jobs and expertise. The city's highly skilled workforce, especially in areas like IT and engineering, would be an asset to any company looking to expand or innovate. Together with that, a significant portion of the city's economy is focused on commerce and services, and it is a major destination for Green Hydrogen within the nation. With a bustling industrial district and many connections with other cities in the region, Fortaleza is also home to major transportation companies, such as Transnordestina from Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional and Expresso Guanabara. In the pharmaceutical segment, it is home to Farm\u00e1cias Pague Menos, the largest pharmaceutical retail chain in Brazil.\n\nIpojuca PE:\nIpojuca is a city located in the state of Pernambuco and is home to the Suape Industrial Port Complex, one of the most important port complexes in Brazil and the most important in the northeast. The port handles a wide range of cargo, including petroleum, petrochemicals, and industrial products. The city is also home to a growing tourism industry, with beautiful beaches and natural attractions. As an SEZ, Ipojuca could attract more investment in these industries, as well as in manufacturing and logistics, including the largest shipyard in the southern hemisphere, Estaleiro Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, responsible for building oil tankers, gas tankers, containers, drilling ships, and offshore platforms. During the 2000s, the municipality received various billion-dollar investments, and by establishing it as an SEZ, we hope that it will attract more significant investments once again.\n\nRecife PE:\nRecife, the capital of the state of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil, is an ideal location for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) due to its unique economic and geographic characteristics. The city is strategically positioned on the Atlantic coast and in close proximity to the Suape Port, making it a crucial center for trade and commerce. By becoming an SEZ, Recife can offer investors a variety of tax incentives and streamlined regulations, making it an even more attractive destination for businesses. Recife has a highly skilled workforce, especially in areas like technology and innovation, which can serve as an asset to any company looking to expand or innovate. The city is home to several renowned universities and research centers, making it an education hub, which provides a large and talented workforce. Additionally, Recife is home to many industrial complexes, including a thriving construction industry, further supporting its economic potential. Moreover, Recife is known for its rich history and diverse culture, which attract tourists from all over the world. A combination of a large supply of labor and significant private investments turned Recife into Brazil's second-largest medical hub. By becoming an SEZ, Recife can leverage this unique blend of culture and industry, further fueling its economic growth. The city's SEZ status could also potentially stimulate the development of new businesses and infrastructure, benefiting the local community and the country's economy as a whole. Along with its rich business environment, Recife has an area dedicated to information technology called \"Porto Digital\" (Digital Port) with more than 140 companies and 7,000 high-tech jobs. It was founded in July 2000 and has since attracted major investments, generating some 15 billion a year, making it a significant logistics hub for Brazil.\n\n\n\n>South<\nFlorianopolis SC:\nFlorian\u00f3polis is the capital and second largest city of the state of Santa Catarina, known worldwide for its focus on research, technology, and software for its economy. It has an ambitious aim of becoming Brazil's Silicon Valley. The city has heavily invested in infrastructure, from roads to schools, and Florian\u00f3polis ranks high on development measures such as literacy. By the late 1990s, private companies began flocking to the island, and during the past decade, technology and software development firms have also experienced strong growth. Today, Information Technology services are one of the top revenue generators in Florian\u00f3polis. Several technology centers are spread around Florian\u00f3polis, making the city an important hub in this economic sector. In the last few years, it has grown greatly. By becoming an SEZ, we can turn Florianopolis's dream of being a second Silicon Valley into a reality. Having a good manufacturing industry as well as being a great tourist attraction, it is sure to attract big tech companies and grow new companies within it.\n\nJoinville SC:\nJoinville, located in the state of Santa Catarina, is a bustling city that will become a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) due to its unique economic and geographic characteristics. As the largest city in the state, Joinville is a major industrial, financial, and commercial center that has experienced significant urban development in recent years. The city's relatively good infrastructure, combined with its strategic location and highly skilled workforce, has turned Joinville into a major center for events and business conferences within Brazil. Joinville's industrial output is the third-largest in the Southern States of Brazil, following the main cities of Porto Alegre and Curitiba. The city has a strong focus on technology and innovation, making it an attractive location for businesses in various sectors, including manufacturing, software development, and engineering. Additionally, Joinville is home to several research centers and universities that contribute to the city's reputation as a hub for innovation.

It would also allow Joinville to expand its existing industries and attract new ones, leading to increased job opportunities and higher standards of living for its residents. Joinville is a thriving city that is well-positioned to become a successful Special Economic Zone. The city is home to a number of large companies, including BMW and Whirlpool.\n\nParanagua PR:\nParanagua, a small city located in the state of Paran\u00e1, Brazil, is a small hidden gem that offers a wealth of opportunities for businesses looking to establish a foothold in the country. Despite its small size, Paranagua boasts one of the busiest ports in Brazil, which is connected to the Pacific through the bioceanic railway. The railway connection is of great significance as it opens up opportunities for businesses to expand their reach and penetrate new markets. Additionally, the city's strategic location makes it an ideal destination for import and export businesses. The economy of Paranagua is primarily driven by its port, which is one of the busiest in Brazil. The port is an important gateway for international trade, connecting Brazil to markets around the world. In addition to its port, Paranagua is also known for its agriculture, with a significant portion of its workforce employed in this sector. The city produces soybeans, corn, and other crops that are exported to markets around the world. That's why we will be making it an SEZ.\n\nPorto Alegre RS:\nPorto Alegre, located in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, boasts a diversified economy with a strong focus on services and industry, including automotive, IT, and petrochemicals. Its strategic location as a port city on the Atlantic coast, along with a well-developed transportation infrastructure, makes it an ideal location for an SEZ. The city's proactive government has already made efforts to attract investment and create favorable conditions for businesses, including tax incentives and streamlined bureaucracy. Furthermore, Porto Alegre's strong focus on sustainability, with a robust waste management system and initiatives to promote renewable energy, aligns with the global trend towards environmentally conscious business practices. By establishing an SEZ in Porto Alegre, businesses can take advantage of the city's unique economic and geographic characteristics, while contributing to the region's continued growth and development. The city is also the fastest-growing city within Brazil and is famous for its sustainability within the nation.\n\n\nTo support the development of these Special Economic Zones (SEZs), the Brazilian government has established a committee that comprises the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Cities, and the Ministry of Labor and Employment. This committee will work closely with the businesses in the SEZs and potential investors who wish to invest in these SEZs to ensure that these zones function as successful economic centers. The government's aim is to facilitate constructive dialogue with private industry players without being overbearing.\n\nThis committee will act as a liaison between the government and the private sector, which will enable businesses to share their plans and ambitions with the government. Based on this feedback, the government will suggest ways to support these companies' goals through infrastructure development projects. The committee will explore various avenues to facilitate these projects, such as creating housing near workplaces, providing labor, and creating planned development synergy between investments and the communities that these workplaces will create.\n\nBy working closely with businesses, the government aims to create an environment that fosters growth and development, attracting both domestic and foreign investment. The committee's focus will be on creating a stable business environment, where companies can operate without the uncertainty of changing regulations and policies.\n\nIn addition to its role as a liaison between businesses and the SEZs, the committee established by the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, Ministry of Cities, and Ministry of Labour and Employment can also serve as a powerful marketing bureau for the SEZs. With its knowledge of the opportunities and resources available in these zones, the committee can actively seek out and contact companies, promoting the advantages of investing in the SEZs and highlighting the benefits of doing business in Brazil. This can include having a strong presence at trade shows, conferences, and other events that attract businesses and investors from around the world. By positioning the SEZs as strategic locations for manufacturing and trade, the committee can help to increase the visibility of Brazil's economy and its potential for growth. Ultimately, this will create a positive image of Brazil as an excellent place to do business and encourage more companies to consider investing in the country.\n\nAnd finally, order to foster the transformation of raw materials extracted in Brazil into finished goods domestically, the Brazilian government will implement a measure that provide companies with specific incentives to keep such resources within the country, except in cases where they have been transformed into manufactured products, like even more significant tax cuts and breaks within the SEZs.\n\n\nBrazil has extremely high hopes and expectations for those SEZs, as they will open up our economy to other nations and companies, if they had such a good and far reaching effect on China, surely it must work on Brazil.\n\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/businessman-economic-growth-concept-260nw-1044515623.jpg", "European Stocks: Which Are The Best?

In recent years, apart from a few brief bull runs, Deutsche Bank stocks have been falling in value.\n\n# BMW\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqkxieb1xau81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=298e6f246b0cb9c3ffd63ab17bfb9c255eb8a02d\n\nAlthough we could have incurred other relevant stocks among German companies, BMW shares are included because it is a stable stock over the last decade, quite solid and with few shocks.\n\nThis may indicate that in a recovery environment such as the one expected after the coronavirus pandemic , the recovery of the shares of this company is more reliable than that of other stocks. However, everything will depend on how we get out of the crisis. \n\nIn general, all companies in the automotive sector see 2020 as a lost year due to the impact on sales that the general state of alarm has caused. It remains to be seen how they recover for the next few years. BMW is a candidate for a good recovery. \n\n[***>>>Join free Capitalist Exploits Newsletter***](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEtS8UZDsY/_E-rZFwOOzuqavE2z-W_OA/view)\n\n[***>>>Join Premium Insider Newsletter starting from just $1***](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEptlUg63w/CG1qWXEd-gHnGOIh0QPzug/view)", "CPChain CEO AMA Answers February 2020 &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfevs42w7wh41.jpg?width=2506&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07dd0e78c303038b98024970d775b43991147191\n\n \n\nDear Community,\n\nIn order to improve the communication between the community\u00a0and the board members of the foundation, we have opened a new regular community event called \"CEO AMA \". Dr. Long, along with other board members will come to take questions every 1-2 months and answer it in the video format.\u00a0\n\nNow we are very pleased to introduce the 1st episode of the year 2020. Given the fact that the AMA is facing both the Chinese and the overseas community, the video is taken in Chinese and we have translated Dr. Long's answer into English and have attached the full context below.\n\nVIDEO LINK (Chinese):  [**https://youtu.be/WBugmFXRg0I**](https://youtu.be/WBugmFXRg0I) \n\n \n\n### (Question Type I) Financial\n\n**1. Do you still have enough money to complete the project? What's the plan if you run out of money? Do you plan to be less opaque in terms of the budget in the future?**\n\nFunds are the lifeblood of the company to achieve sustainable development. The foundation has been pursuing prudent, stable and open financial expenditure and disclosure policies, and publicly released the financial reports\u00a0to the community around every 4 months since last year. The main expenditures in the past two years were in R&D, exchanges and operations. The industry application in fields of Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and the Vehicle Identity Standard (VID) are being developed at a strong pace.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, because the price of\u00a0ETH in 2019 was\u00a0at a low level for a long period of time, the cost of\u00a0R&D and other expenses was relatively\u00a0high. 2020 is different from 2019, we need to be careful about spending our resources. We need to follow our financial plan wisely and constantly adjust the team size to support a sustainable development strategy. Saving money is only one side of our story. On the other hand, we need to keep on seeking funds. Luckily, we're in a good position to find what we want. The supportive attitude from the Chinese government towards blockchain technology will lead us to more partners in fields of smart city, smart transportation, smart medical care and so on, which will have a great chance to brings external funds for us.\n\n**2.\u00a0What is the reason the team kept 30% of the outstanding Rnode rewards?**\n\nWhen launching the mainnet, we kept several team-owned RNodes in the system for the sake of overall environment stability. We have deployed servers\u00a0and consumed some of the\u00a0computing and financial resources to support it. Of course, given the fact that we were\u00a0still at the early stage of mainnet operations, we returned all of the rewards generated by us to the community one-time last year regardless of the cost of the operation.\u00a0However, 30% of the return was distributed separately to the Industry Nodes. The reason for doing so is that Industry Node has some tech advantages over ordinary RNodes in terms of maintaining the mainnet.\u00a0They have also contributed more in chain maintenance and some other perspectives such as tech co-research and business introduction. So, we decided to give them a separate small portion of rewards directly. **One thing we need to clarify is that we have never taken the team reward as our own property. It should be and will be in the future, given back to the contributors from the community.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**3.\u00a0In the TG Trippledutch mentioned that in the future the rewards will be paid in Stable coins. Is this true, will it be a new stable coin or an existing one, what will be the value for one block and in what timeframe we're talking?**\n\nI think you are referring to the dual token model system. The intention to introduce stable coins as a payment method results from the idea that it can solve the cost instability problem for\u00a0blockchain developers and users. However, after internal research for a long time, we concluded that for now a stable coin/dual token system is not beneficial enough to solve the above question. We leave room for such discussions and updates in the future and we welcome the community to share your thoughts with us.\n\nTalking about stable coins, we are actually exploring the potential with our partners about tokenizing physical assets on our mainnet.\u00a0\n\n**4.\u00a0When will the reward sharing model of the side chains be announced and what will it look like?**\n\nFirst of all, we appreciate our core investors\u00a0so much for the revenue sharing proposal and we have discussed the idea internally. The foundation is definitely open for it. We are now under the final internal assessment towards the proposal so please be patient. When talking about the proposal, it reminds me exactly of the kind of community contributions we are seeking for. We are very eager to create as much value as possible for the community and our business partners. Given the current policy and tech climate in both China and the rest part of the world, our focus is still mainly allocated in business adoption. Blockchain technology has huge potential in the fields of Smart City, Smart Medical and International trading, etc., especially in China. We welcome all sorts of business proposals and introductions. Of course with successful introductions, the contributors will be rewarded.\u00a0\n\n**5.\u00a0Are there ongoing talks with Chinese investors or venture capital to fund the company? If so, is it equity in the company or Cpchain tokens that they are provided with?**\n\nYes, we are in talks with several Chinese institutional investors to seek partnerships. But still, it is under discussion and under the current Chinese policy climate, the talks might still take a long time.\u00a0\n\nFor now, the top priority for us is not finding direct investments but industry partnerships, which we believe will bring real long-term support for us.\u00a0\n\n### (Question Type II) R&D\n\n**1.\u00a0When the CPC wallet will support a cold wallet as ledger nano?**\n\nWe have finished the development of the cold wallet several months ago. We are still in constant negotiation with cold wallet manufacturers to incorporate our wallet firmware. The detailed timeframe now is not in our hands but depends on the speed of cold wallet providers.\u00a0\n\n**2.\u00a0The proof of concept projects that were talked about include Smart Cities, Medical, and VID? Are all three areas still being explored and what is the general percentage of working hours being allocated to each POC? (For instance, VID 50%/medical 25%/smart cities 25%)**\n\nThese three areas are all on our plan. The projects are underlyingly related and we are making overall progress on all of them.\n\n**3.\u00a0How many RNodes are owned by CPChain and how many nodes is the target by CPChain to own? Second, is there also a target for CPChain in regard to the number of public nodes?**\n\nAt the moment, we have 12 RNodes of which 4 nodes will participate in every round of the block sealing process to ensure network stability.\n\nThere is no upper limit on the number of public nodes to join the network. We aim for a versatile and strong network with more public Rnodes joining in.\n\n**4.\u00a0Can you reveal a bit about what to expect this year, what kind of developments are being made, how is progress going with what you are working on, what kind of tech will be implemented and used this year and what is planned for next year?**\n\nBlockchain technologies are evolving at a very fast pace; however, few are stable and usable. We plan to consolidate our existing products by making it more acceptable to the industry users.\u00a0In the meantime, we will pioneer in applying Decentralized Identifiers (DID) with special techniques such as secure multiparty computation.\u00a0Building an open, secure, and flexible ID system has always been the top item on our agenda.\n\n**5.\u00a0How far away is CPChain from being used in real-world cases? And what is the biggest problem in implementing this technology?**\n\nWe are actively expanding our market coverage. The biggest problem has never been technology, but people\u2019s mindset of adopting blockchain technology.\n\n**6. When can we expect the first transactions on mainet from real-world usage?**\n\nDID will most likely be the first big real-world use case, which will happen when the market is ready.\n\n**7. When will the Economy Node Reward Program open to the community on CPC wallet?**\n\nWe understand that the community wants E-nodes in the wallet opened to the public ASAP. However, please understand our concern around the still strict policy in China, we need to wait for a more open policy climate before we go ahead with implementing the Enodes.\u00a0\n\n### (Question Type III) Community Operations and Marketing\n\n**1.\u00a0Dear Team, last year it was said many times that the team would improve on communication, but the real fact is that they didn't. This caused a great loss of trust within the community and many people lost faith and exited as an investor which hurts us all. What is CPChain going to do in regards to communication except for making promises?**\n\nWe know crystal clear the importance of communication. I think in 2019 we\u2019ve started with a very clear communication strategy where our interactions with the community should be from multiple aspects. On one hand, we started regular community releases regarding R&D, BD, FR & so on. On the other hand, we scheduled our marketing budget in a very conservative way to make sure the right event could get the right promotion. However, we did notice the louder and louder voice on the topic of the board getting in front of the community more frequently. That is the reason why starting from 2020, the board will get more appearance in front of the community.\n\nLast year I was more involved in leading the team in real-world adoption research. As we all know, this process is time-consuming and not all details can be revealed in the middle of the developments. So, I have to ask you to be patient, we will give out updates once all parties involved agree to do so.\n\n**2.\u00a0Is lack of marketing due to regulatory constraints in China or just incompetence from the team? Can we expect any marketing push this year? If so, please invest it wisely and PROOFREAD all releases.**\n\nThe reason why we didn't have a lot of marketing in the past can be concluded in 2 aspects: Firstly, the market has been very unstable in the last year and we don't want to take risks to spend money in this poor overall market climate. Secondly, just as you mentioned in your question, in 2019 the token-issued projects in China faced relatively strict regulations. We had to turn our heads down.\n\nOne more thing to mention, we intend to spend more marketing resources to support the adoption of our technology. We are working on it with our partners and I am quite optimistic that this year we will have a few great achievements in this area so we can spend some resources to let people know about our developments.\n\n**3.\u00a0Are you aware of the 'cpchainisascam'  Telegram channel and what do you have to say regarding its 21 members that accuse you of fraud and other misbehavior?**\n\nWe are aware of the existence of this group. We were initially shocked but after that, we found it understandable and we felt really sorry for those who are in the group. Everyone has the right to express their frustrations about a project whose value has dropped so much. We will have more talks with the community to prove our real value.\u00a0\n\nWe sincerely accept advice as well as criticism from the community. However, we are not scammers and will never accept the \"scam project\" tag for the sake of all hard-working staff onsite.\u00a0\n\n**4.\u00a0Why do you allow your admins to ban investors from the CPC Telegram just because they take things personally?**\n\nTelegram admins have done a great job for us to help connect the community with the onshore team. We believe and have witnessed their way of work and we trust them for 100%. People who spread serious FUD will be banned because they have no place in our community.\n\n### (Question Type IV) Business Development\n\n**1. Will BMW make use of the public chain this year and will we see some proof that they are partnered with CPChain and making use of the public chain?**\n\nCPChain is the technology service provider of BMW China. In the past, we have worked closely with the innovation department of BMW China to explore the blockchain solution in fields of the mobility industry AND have received PoC orders from their source\u00a0department. As for the question of whether BMW will finally use the public chain, it\u2019s not in our hands but based on their judgment upon the business value of the blockchain technology. After so much time spending with BMW Asia and working together with them, I am very optimistic about our future with them.\u00a0\n\n**2.\u00a0Why isn't MOBI mentioning CPC in their articles? Can you give as proof that your MOBI partnership substantial? Is there any document of proof?**\n\nWe have a very close relationship with MOBI. We are members of MOBI VID working standard. You can see our name on the VID document. Last year we attended the MOBI LA conference and met some of our community members onsite. In the future, we will keep on working with them to bring in the real-world adoption of blockchain technology.\u00a0\n\n**3.\u00a0Can you name some of CPChain's biggest strengths? And are there any new partnerships in the near future?**\n\nThe biggest advantage of CPChain is that through continuous development and exploration in the past two years, we have built a ready-made, IOT-oriented infrastructure. Next, we will try\u00a0hard to combine\u00a0our infrastructure with the actual industry needs. In\u00a0the process of discussion and communication with external companies, I deeply felt the potential in our technology. For example, last December, we went to a real estate big data company in Shanghai to conduct business research and communication. They have a team of 20 to\u00a030 people to make a financial product for Shanghai real estate data sharing. This product can perfectly combine with PDASH.\u00a0 Now we are also in talks with them about co-development. But because of the coronavirus in China, the talks are a little bit behind the schedule.\u00a0\n\n**4.\u00a0Is CPChain also still involved with smart city projects?**\n\nYes, we are having in-depth communications with related companies to explore how to apply blockchain technology to smart cities and smart transportation projects. Take an example from Shanghai. Shanghai government is currently working on a project to upgrade\u00a0roadside parking monitoring and payment system. And they are very interested in bringing the blockchain technology into real-world use. We are among a few projects that are\u00a0actively discussing with them.\u00a0\n\n**5.\u00a0As CPC is now primarily focused on working on Vehicle Identity Standard (=VID) of MOBI how will CPC try to incorporate some tokennomics that can give value to the tokens?**\n\nThis is also one of the topics that we are talking about with different enterprises in the mobility industry. Like many of them, CPChain is always seeking ways to introduce efficient token systems into their existing product lines. However, considering the current climate, it is temporarily not possible in China to publicly work on token implementations so we focus on implementation for all our overseas partners.\n\n### (Question Type V) Staff ,Team & Future Plan\n\n**1.\u00a0There is no trace of the team on the website for months. This can be seen as a red flag for investors. When will it come back?**\n\nAs we have mentioned before, we have taken down the team information to avoid any risk for the staff during the stricter policy restriction in China. We are still waiting for a more open attitude from the government before we make our team members public again.\n\n**2.\u00a0Are any outside developers working on CPchain projects?**\n\nWe have seen enthusiastic developers from the community creating great work such as the\u00a0[https://rnodes.io](https://rnodes.io/)\u00a0and cpcstats.com explorers. And we will keep on seeking a close relationship\u00a0with the community to fully deploy the potential of the community. However, there is no employment-relationship with outside developers at the moment.\n\n**3.\u00a0Did the CPChain team reduce in size to cut costs as funds are now low?**\n\nIt\u2019s a normal team re-organization for a two-year-old company. We are continuously consolidating our resources for a more efficient work environment.\n\n**4.\u00a0Do any of the employees have the option to be paid in CPChain tokens and if so, do any of them take that option?**\n\nOur employees do have the right to choose to be paid in CPC. However, the reality is for now most of the rewards payed in CPC for our onshore team are not in the form of salary but in the form of CPC lock-up rewards.\u00a0\n\n### (Question Type VI) Price\n\n**1. Has the team considered the use of MM to coincide with the new exchange listing?**\n\nWe obviously cannot say too much. Like we have mentioned before, we are very careful about spending resources on market making. We're always open for it but only when the time is right.\n\n**2.\u00a0It seems that the market is in the bull run but CPC doesn't pump. Will the team do something in terms of marketing in order to attract new investors?**\n\nYes, we have reserved the spot and the budget for marketing in 2020. And regarding price I do have more to say:\n\nI hold a firm idea that\u00a0the current price\u00a0does\u00a0not truly reflect our actual value. Now if we have a lot of action\u00a0on the price, no matter it is through market-making or through other methods, it can only produce short-term effects. In my opinion, it\u2019s harmful to the resources at hand. If we consume too many resources, the project will not be sustainable. I think there is a certain contradiction between short-term price and long-term development. This should be\u00a0a common proposition for both the team and the community. We still have to consider this issue from a relatively medium (1-2 years) and long-term (5-year) perspective. In this process, we need to improve communications with and maintain the confidence of the community. We understand the concerns of the community and individual investors but we also want to ask the everyone to maintain confident in us and give us the time we need to successfully roll out our developments.\n\n### (Question Type VII) Others\n\n**1.\u00a0Has the outbreak of coronavirus affected the company team? What is the company's current working status?**\n\nFirst of all, I wish all of our community members have a healthy body. I am also confident, under effective control by the Chinese government, the crisis will bypass very soon\u00a0in the near future. The coronavirus this time\u00a0does have some adverse impact on us, but only to a limited extent. Other than being physically apart, we remote work if needed. More impact is actually reflected on the BD side, due to the large-scale delay in returning to the office, our BD is postponed to some extent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**2. Will there be any good news in the upcoming 1-2 months?**\n\nLet us first wait for some good news in the next 2-3 weeks. The team is working very hard on reaching their set goals, once important goals are met, we will share them with the community.\n\n### (Summary)\n\nMy dear community members, please allow me to represent the foundation to wish all of you a happy Chinese New Year. In this special 2020, I wish everybody have a strong body and good luck all year long. This year we will have more close interaction with the community and I believe 2020 is the year that our technology will realize real-world adoption. Thank you again and see you in the next video.\u00a0", "[DIPLOMACY] India Seeks International Cooperation on 'Greening' its Economy #August 2021\n\nThe Indian Government has made moves seeking to hold a major international conference in New Delhi on what the Prime Minister has called 'Greening the Economy', that is, establishing how India can develop its economy, grow its wealth and improve the lives of its citizens without negatively impacting on the environment.  Indeed, the PM has laid out his belief, in which he has been joined by the leader of the opposition, that the economic sustainability of India's economy is vital not just for its own survival, but the survival of the world.  \n\nIndia is not just interested in its own path, but in fostering connections between a great many companies, countries, NGOs, individuals and so on.  To that end the Indian government will be inviting representatives to a major 'Green Buisness Expo', that it now hopes to hold every two years in India, and will hope that leading lights in the world will attend to network.  \n\nThis expo, to be called 'GreenEx' will be held next May in New Delhi.\n\nIndia will be inviting representatives from major 'tech economies' which may be interested in selling to India or, better yet, be interested in putting their products into mass manufacture in India:\n\n* Japan - An Invitation will be extended to several Japanese firms.  Fujitsu for example, alongside car manufacturers Toyota, Suzuki and Nissan who produce hybrid and electric vehicles.  \n\n* Germany - Firms such as Siemens, BMW and Volkswagen will be invited.  \n\n* France - French firms such as EDF will be invited to the Expo to showcase their technology, while french auto company Renault will be invited to display it's electric vehicle technology.\n\n* USA - From the USA of course many firms will be invited, but the event organisers are most keen of all to see Boeing, General Electric and, if possible, Tesla flaunt their wares at the expo.\n\nIn addition business leaders in India are to be invited, community leaders too, and some of the leading academics of the world, from environmental scientists to demographers to experts in town planning.  ", "Inside James Dyson\u2019s Costly Decision to Kill His Electric Car **James Dyson,** the billionaire British inventor and entrepreneur, is standing on a small stage at the mid-September gala opening of his new flagship retail store in Paris. The space is more high-end art gallery than appliance mart: matte black walls and ceiling, gray tile floors, and stylish gadgets displayed like sculptures, spotlighted on white-topped plinths.\u00a0\n\nDyson, spry and lanky at 72 years old, is wearing owlish blue-frame glasses and a copper-toned, thigh-length jacket evocative of a mad scientist\u2019s lab coat. In his cut-glass English accent he\u2019s running through his company\u2019s latest wares: a hair dryer that uses circular airflow to avoid heat damage; a hair styler that wraps curls using a vortex of air; a bladeless oval air purifier that blows hot and cold; a combination water faucet and hand dryer. The list goes on, ending, inevitably, with a cordless vacuum cleaner, the category consumers most closely associate with Dyson\u2019s name.\u00a0\n\nFor all the eye-catching design and technological wonder of Dyson\u2019s body of work, many in the audience are hoping he\u2019ll make a pronouncement about the one much-discussed Dyson product that\u2019s not yet for sale. Then the great man utters the words they\u2019ve longed to hear: \u201cthe car.\u201d He flicks to an aerial photograph, not of an automobile, but of the former Royal Air Force base in rural England where his team has been working in great secrecy to design an electric vehicle. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I\u2019ll say about the car this evening,\u201d he declares. True to his word, he pivots to rhapsodizing about an LED lamp designed by his 47-year-old son and heir apparent, Jake.\n\nWithin weeks, the reason behind Dyson\u2019s reticence becomes clear: He had already decided the car project was doomed. In fact, while he was exuberantly peddling vacuums and hair stylers, his bankers were unsuccessfully scrambling to find a buyer for the electric vehicle program to which Dyson had committed four years, hundreds of engineers, and 2\u00a0billion pounds ($2.5 billion). On Oct.\u00a010, Dyson said his privately held company would cease work on the project, ending his electric car dreams before the first model ever rolled off the assembly line.\u00a0\n\nBUNKER MENTALITY: Reminders of World War II, like this hangar, remain at the former air base, where Dyson prototyped its doomed car.COURTESY OF DYSONIt was a gutsy decision and a rare public setback for Dyson, who, with his family, owns the entirety of the company that bears his name. He had put his estimable reputation on the line with the car, promising a \u201cradically different\u201d vehicle that would feature \u201crevolutionary\u201d battery technology while outperforming more experienced competitors. And he had promised to have it in customers\u2019 hands by 2021, a dramatically short time frame for a neophyte automaker. In the end, a chagrined Dyson says the decision came down to a simple business proposition. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t commercially viable,\u201d he said, in an exclusive interview with _Fortune_the day after news broke of the car\u2019s demise. Although Dyson\u2019s crack auto team successfully created an innovative new car, he wasn\u2019t willing to price it below cost, as he believes the competition is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, really, because our engineers have done a brilliant job.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDyson\u2019s inability to produce a profitable automobile speaks volumes about the current perilous state of the electric vehicle industry, in which companies like Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and Chinese startup Nio are burning through billions of dollars annually with no sign of black ink on the horizon. The story of his audacious but ultimately failed project also says much about Dyson, the rare executive who can combine blue-sky dreaming with steely-eyed financial discipline. At a time when every company speaks about innovation and disruption, Dyson\u2019s decision to kill his electric car is a case study in the delicate balancing act of embracing ingenuity while keeping an eye on profits.\u00a0\n\n********\n\n**Improbable** though it seems in retrospect, there were good reasons for James Dyson to attempt to make an all-electric automobile. Electrification presented a once-in-a-century opportunity in the auto industry, one that Dyson was not alone in spotting. Electric powertrains require only about 20 moving parts compared with more than 2,000 for cars with internal\u00a0combustion engines\u2014a fact that theoretically lowers barriers to entry. What\u2019s more, Tesla had caught the global automotive industry sleeping on EVs, and several years ago, it looked as if there was room for more entrants. [Apple](/fortune500/apple/) was rumored to be working on a car, for example, as was [Google](/fortune500/alphabet/). \u201cAnybody can build an electric car,\u201d veteran automotive analyst Maryann Keller says. \u201cIt\u2019s an open playing field.\u201d\n\nDyson thought he had a better shot than most. His company was thriving, with 2018 sales jumping 25% to a record $5.6\u00a0billion. Pretax operating profits topped $1\u00a0billion for the first time, driven by strong demand in Asia, where Dyson is a status-conferring consumer brand. Through its vacuums, Dyson\u2019s company already was a global leader in electric motors. It knew batteries too, thanks to its cordless products. Key EV concepts like airflow and climate control also were present in all of Dyson\u2019s appliances. \u201cWhen we realized, almost by accident, that we had the technology to build an electric car, it was natural to go into it,\u201d Dyson says. Back in 2015, when he first conceived of it, Dyson says there seemed to be ample room in the market for a chassis-to-moonroof rethink of what an EV should be. \u201cYou have to remember that four or five years ago, only Tesla was on the scene,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it was a very different sort of environment.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe inventor had made a career of proving skeptics wrong. He\u2019d successfully reimagined one mundane household product after another, starting with an innovative wheelbarrow in 1974. He\u2019d made his name and fortune with the bagless vacuum cleaner, which used a \u201ccyclone\u201d effect to draw dust out of the air. Launched in 1993, the vacuums featured a transparent bin that let you see exactly how much dust you\u2019d sucked up. (He famously overruled marketing experts who told him no one would buy a vacuum that showcased the dirt.) New models included advancements such as ball-like handle attachments for maneuvering into tight corners. Slim cordless uprights were made possible by the company\u2019s electric motor research. Dyson was also adept at extending his expertise into new categories, like the Airblade hand dryer as well as bladeless fans and air purifiers.\u00a0\n\nWhile a car may have looked like a leap, \u00adDyson had been building up to designing one for years, in part because of a hankering to invent a solution for the pollution-spewing internal combustion engine. Affronted by the smell and smoke from diesel engines, in the late 1980s and early 1990s he developed a filter for the particulate belched by trucks, based on technology used in his bagless vacuum. But trucking companies refused to buy it, he says, because they didn\u2019t want to have to empty the filter. He also blames U.K. and European regulators who insisted that diesel was \u201cgreen and clean,\u201d despite abundant scientific evidence of ill-health effects. \u201cThere was a sort of jilted feeling,\u201d he says, acknowledging his search for new technology \u201chas been lurking\u201d ever since. Grand projects have been started for shakier reasons.\u00a0\n\n********\n\nJames Dyson\n-----------\n\n**At 72, the British inventor\u00a0has been innovating his whole adult life. His contraptions span from gardening to hair styling.**\n\n### Inventor\n\nDyson\u2019s first hit came in 1974, a redesigned wheelbarrow that replaced the typical narrow rubber wheel with a plastic sphere that resisted sinking into muddy ground. He called it the \u00adBallbarrow.\n\nDyson then turned his attention to the bagless vacuum. It took a decade and 5,127 prototypes to perfect his design for the product that ultimately would make his name and fortune.\u00a0\n\n### Environmentalist\n\nDyson has been worked up about pollution for decades, but not out of concern for global warming. He loathed the exhaust spewed into the air by diesel-burning engines popular in Europe. \u201cI hated the smell,\u201d he says. \u201cI hated the black smoke.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe developed a filter to capture diesel particulates but couldn\u2019t persuade trucking companies to buy it. His dislike of fossil-fuel burning engines persisted.\n\n### Landowner, philanthropist, patriot\n\nAside from his day job, Dyson runs a profitable agriculture business. He owns more farmland than anyone else in the U.K., including Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHis James Dyson Foundation runs an annual award program in 27 countries, in search of the most innovative inventions. To train more U.K. engineers, he founded the James Dyson Institute, which offers undergraduates free engineering degrees and work experience.\n\nHe also likes to display the work of other British inventors on the grounds of his company\u2019s corporate campus in rural Wiltshire, 100 miles west of London. A Brexit supporter, Dyson had critics who chafed at his plans to relocate HQ to Singapore.\u00a0\n\n### Secret Keeper\n\nDyson is a 14,000-person company whose paranoia for protecting corporate secrets, dating back to piracy of the Ballbarrow\u2019s design, rivals Apple\u2019s. It is an active litigant on its patent portfolio, having tussled with the likes of Hoover and Samsung.Employees generally operate on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis and are expected not to discuss projects outside their teams, including in communal cafeterias.\n\n********\n\n**Work on** the top-secret car program began in earnest in 2015, as Dyson recruited auto industry veterans from Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover. The company is accustomed to operating clandestinely. Bitter experience from Dyson\u2019s earliest days as an inventor, when he says a competitor pinched his wheelbarrow design, taught the entrepreneur to be paranoid. Products inside the company are known only by a number until they are publicly unveiled. (An early version of the doomed car was called \u201cN526.\u201d) Fingerprint scanners control access to labs.\u00a0\n\nBut this time the secret got out. The U.K. government accidentally revealed Dyson\u2019s work on an electric car in an industrial strategy report it published online. That, and the increasing scale of the endeavor\u2014which included a 200-million-pound refurbishment of the old RAF airfield to serve as the design and testing hub for the car and the hiring of hundreds of people\u2014forced Dyson to come clean. In September 2017, he held a press conference in London to officially announce the project, saying he was committing 2\u00a0billion pounds to the endeavor, including 1\u00a0billion aimed at producing a breakthrough in battery technology.\u00a0\n\nAutomotive experts thought the sum was paltry compared with what would be needed to build a car. But it was orders of magnitude bigger than anything Dyson had ever spent on a new product. Its Supersonic hair dryer, for instance, which it launched in 2016, had taken four years and cost $71\u00a0million to develop. Many also doubted Dyson\u2019s premise that its technical know-how would transfer to electric cars. \u201cAn electric vehicle is not just a big hair dryer,\u201d says George Crabtree, director of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Joint Center for Energy Storage Research at the Argonne National Laboratory.\u00a0\n\nDyson was undeterred. The company was committed to rethinking the car from first principles\u2014a philosophy that had underpinned Dyson\u2019s success in household products. \u201cWe wanted to change everything and not use other people\u2019s architectural layout,\u201d Dyson says. The company would design all its components in-house, from motors to windshield wipers. \u201cIf you look at the way other auto companies operate, they treat components as black boxes,\u201d says Andrew Clothier, Dyson\u2019s director of technical research. They buy parts off the shelf and bolt them together. That\u2019s cheaper and faster but comes at the expense of innovation, he says. Dyson would try a completely different approach. (Tesla also designs its own electric motors, battery packs, and chargers.)\n\nThe car Dyson\u2019s team came up with was about the size of a Range Rover but with a longer wheelbase; a lower roofline; and a short, stubbed nose leading to a dramatically sloped windscreen, according to patent filings made public in May. Dyson says now the long wheelbase was necessary to accommodate a very large battery pack that would have given the car more range than any EV currently on the market. The tires were taller and narrower than usual too. That reduced rolling resistance as well as accommodating more interior space and, by allowing for lower tire pressure, provided a more comfortable ride. \u201cWe were after aerodynamic efficiency, rolling resistance efficiency, electric motor efficiency, and battery efficiency,\u201d Dyson says.\n\nEvery EV on the road today uses \u201cwet\u201d \u00adlithium-ion batteries, in which a cathode made of lithium mixed with other metals (usually nickel, manganese, and cobalt) is separated from a graphite anode by an electrolyte solution. These cells are efficient but take time to charge and are prone to catching fire. Dyson thought he could gain an edge by using solid-state batteries instead. Such batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte with a ceramic material and use a pure lithium metal anode, are the Holy Grail for EVs. They pack more power for their weight, meaning they would vastly extend the car\u2019s range. They also charge far faster and are much safer.\u00a0\n\nLast year, Dyson selected Singapore as the site for his future EV factory. The company already made its other products in neighboring Malaysia, and it saw the region as a key potential market for the car. Then, earlier this year, Dyson announced it would shift its global corporate headquarters to Singapore too. The founder bought a $54 million penthouse apartment in the city-state. Tabloids leveled accusations of betrayal at the entrepreneur, who had called for a revival of British industrial prowess and is a prominent proponent of Brexit, the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Dyson notes he continues to employ 5,000 people in the U.K.\u00a0\n\n********\n\n**All along,** James Dyson knew this project was likely to be harder than any he\u2019d attempted previously. And that was before automakers like [General Motors](https://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors/), Volkswagen, and others committed wholeheartedly to EVs. He knew that he\u2019d have to spend a lot of money and that without a dealer network, he would have to rely on direct sales through digital channels, much like Tesla, and find a way to support and service the cars in the aftermarket. But he was unprepared for just how tough the task would prove to be.\u00a0\n\nMost daunting was the competition. European and Chinese regulatory moves to ban gas engines in coming decades acted as a catalyst for major automakers. Together, they are expected to pump $300\u00a0billion into electric car development in the next decade. Suddenly, Dyson\u2019s team faced a financial reckoning just as it was time to begin installing manufacturing equipment in Singapore. \u201cDoing everything from scratch probably put up the cost,\u201d Dyson reflects. He also says that because the company could not guarantee high volumes, it could not strike the best deals with suppliers, as it had throughout decades of building appliances. And, without revealing any details, he admits the battery that the company wanted to use was more expensive than industry standards.\n\nDyson always knew his car wouldn\u2019t be cheap. He had previously joked to reporters that it might be more appropriate to talk about the size of the down payment required to buy one rather than the sticker price. But there\u2019s expensive, and then there\u2019s exorbitant. If his EV were to turn a profit, it would have to enter the market \u201cright at the top end,\u201d Dyson says. While he declines to reveal the price the company was considering, the Tesla Model X starts at about $104,000, and Faraday Future, a Chinese-backed startup in California, is planning to launch an ultraluxury SUV that may cost as much as $180,000. \u201cIt\u2019s a price where we could sell some but not enough,\u201d Dyson says.\n\nA NOT-SO-SIMPLE PLAN: Patent applications hint at what a Dyson car might have looked like.Courtesy of DysonAt the end of the day, Dyson didn\u2019t blink at the \u201csunk costs\u201d of capital already invested in the car project. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the investment at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d already committed that.\u201d Fiscally conservative, Dyson says he would never consider putting his company in financial jeopardy for the sake of his car. At the end of 2018, Dyson\u2019s debt was a manageable 368\u202fmillion pounds ($492 million), most of it long term. He refused to overleverage Dyson or take it public, which would dilute his control. \u201cWe don\u2019t have endless shareholders\u2019 money or the potential to raise shareholders\u2019 money,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a family business.\u201d\n\nDyson says he focused on \u201cthe BAM\u201d\u2014the build and materials cost\u2014of the car and therefore where he\u2019d have to price it to earn an acceptable margin. What worried Dyson wasn\u2019t the billions competitors were investing in EVs; it was their willingness to sell cars at a loss. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst who tracks the EV sector for the consulting firm Navigant, says the break-even price for a generic electric car is about $80,000. Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar all have electric luxury SUVs entering the market this year with a starting price of around $70,000. And Tesla and Nio are selling mass-market electric cars at half that price. (Tesla\u2019s burn rate hit an annual pace of $3.5\u00a0billion in 2018\u2014more than Dyson had pledged to its entire EV project.) Dyson feared his EV would look even pricier in comparison.\u00a0\n\nOnce before, Dyson had faced a similar dilemma. In November 2000, the company unveiled a washing machine called the Contrarotator. The ingenious design had two drums that spun in opposite directions. But, as with the car, Dyson says, the company\u2019s novel design and low volumes gave it little leverage with suppliers. \u201cI worked out it cost at least two-and-half times more to make than a conventional washing machine,\u201d he says. Ultimately, Dyson sold the washers for about 1,000 pounds ($1,500 at the time), at least 30% more than competitors\u2019, and even then it lost money on every one. Eventually, in 2005, the company decided to discontinue it. Dyson vowed never to sell a product below cost again.\n\nBefore deciding to abandon the car, Dyson hired bankers to try to sell the division. They approached \u201call the people you might imagine,\u201d says Dyson. (The _Financial Times_reported Jaguar Land Rover was among them.) No one bit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really get close to anyone,\u201d he says. In late September, Dyson made the fateful decision to pull the plug.\u00a0\n\nKilling fledgling products actually isn\u2019t that unusual for Dyson. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d says Stephen Courtney, Dyson\u2019s concept director. \u201cBut it is sort of the nature of working in research.\u201d Normally, the buttoned-up company fails privately and quietly. With the EV, competitors, gearheads, battery experts, and business journalists were scrutinizing its every move. \u201cIt was the hardest decision we\u2019ve ever had to make,\u201d says Dyson. \u201cSo many designers and engineers have put so much effort into it, and it hadn\u2019t seen the light of day.\u201d The company plans to find roles elsewhere for as many as possible of the 523 employees who worked on the car. But there won\u2019t be room for all of them.\u00a0\n\nALL IMAGES COURTESY OF DYSON\n********\n\n**Dyson\u2019s 67-acre** corporate campus in Malmesbury, about 100 miles west of London, is sprinkled with iconic examples of ingenious industrial design, among them an original Alec Issigonis\u2013designed Mini Cooper, bisected to show off its clever use of interior space; a Honda Super Cub motorcycle; and two British fighter jets. One day a prototype of Dyson\u2019s electric car may join them. In the meantime, there are already hints that the company\u2019s automotive efforts won\u2019t be wasted.\u00a0\n\nIn a windowless industrial shed being constructed behind Dyson\u2019s striking mirrored-glass D9 research lab, the company has built the largest advanced prototyping lab for solid-state batteries in Europe. Beyond EVs, solid-state batteries have potential uses in everything from mobile phones to consumer electronics to aircraft. And Dyson says it will continue its investment in them. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got something that is groundbreaking and revolutionary,\u201d says Mike Rendall, Dyson\u2019s head of energy storage industrialization. Called D9A, the new battery prototyping facility should enable Dyson \u201cto bring solid-state batteries to market as soon as possible,\u201d Rendall says.\n\nThe company is also investing heavily in robotics with uses beyond automobiles. Inside a section of the secretive D9 building, a team of 65 robotics researchers are working on machinery, much of it hidden under tarps for a journalist\u2019s visit. It is clear from what little is visible\u2014like the big brown armchair, curiously perched on a table, upon which sits something big under a sheet\u2014that it is not simply an evolution of its existing robot vacuum cleaner, the Dyson\u2019s 360 Eye. Dyson\u2019s director of robotics research, Vincent Clerc, previously led SoftBank\u2019s design of its humanoid robots \u00adPepper and Romeo. Is Dyson developing a fully humanoid robot butler or maid? Clerc won\u2019t say, although he allows that the company is focused on getting robots to perceive the world in three\u00a0dimensions.\u00a0\n\nThe day after canceling the car, Dyson seems subdued but philosophical. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of exciting stuff,\u201d he says of his product pipeline, including gadgets that may benefit from the automotive research. \u201cAnd the silver lining of this horrible decision is we can concentrate on those.\u201d Dyson may have missed his chance to beat rival billionaire Elon Musk. But the inventor seems eager to get back to the lab and put his name on yet another breakthrough product.\u2002\n\n_A version of this article appears in the November 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cJames Dyson\u2019s Electric Shock.\u201d_### More must-read stories from _Fortune_:\n\n\u2014Trump\u2019s tariffs were supposed to ding China, but [the U.S. economy is getting hit 2.5x harder\n   \n](https://fortune.com/2019/10/08/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-us-economy-impact/)\u2014Inside JP Morgan, [moving on from WeWork](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/jpmorgan-wework-adam-neumann-ipo/) is proving to be a messy proposition\n   \n \u20145 beermakers to watch from [2019\u2019s Great American Beer Festival\n   \n](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/up-and-coming-beer-brewers-gabf-2019/)\u2014A [key change to mortgage lending rules](https://fortune.com/2019/08/14/mortgage-lending-rule-change/) is coming in 2021.

I spent my career at FAANG (I'm FIRE now) in the Seattle area. I viewed my position as a winning lottery ticket. Anyone at a higher leadership level at a FAANG makes such an insane salary (by a comparison to any normal income) that FI is clearly possible. Since every one of my peers should have made $300k annually or often much more, you would expect that they're all working because they love the work, not because they still need the money.\n\nEven with these high salaries, the majority of my co-workers spent a significant percentage of their income. They would talk about anxiously waiting for a stock vesting to pay off some bills. They'd talk about how their car payment (on their Tesla, or fancy BMW) was almost done, which was a relief because it was hard to make ends meet.\n\nI remember talking to someone who was certainly making 7 figures a year, and had been for years. They said they needed probably another 10+ years to be able to retire, if they could cut down on their expenses. With complete seriousness they said that their third vacation home was probably too expensive, and they needed to really figure out a family budget.\n\nIn the end, if you make a \"decent\" income, it is 100% about lifestyle creep. It's not necessarily about living like a college student (e.g. leanfire). Lifestyle creep's impact surprises people. It's not always about a third vacation home. Sometimes it's about the slightly more expensive car, and the slightly more expensive vacation, and the slightly nicer clothes. Next thing you know, you've received lovely 5% a year raises, with 6% a year expense increases. That's digging a hole, not improving your situation.\n\nAnyway, my main point is that income is necessary up to a certain point to be able to achieve FIRE, but the majority of people above that line shoot themselves in the foot all on their own :)", "Reminder From Someone Who Won $400K+ Gambling \n\nHey everyone - I do **text interviews** with people who receive and lose windfalls.

Despite the fact that I have no contact with my friends from high school at this point and I rarely stay in touch with Indian politics or pop culture, I am still an Indian living in America. I take a lot of pride and joy in witnessing India's economic and cultural progress over time. My value system is pretty much at odds with \"narrow mindedness\" of some Indians (based on my observation among the extended family members), but I always figured that Indians will just become more aware of the social injustice around them and start uniting against them as it further develops economically. Maybe I bought into the whole Maslow\u2019s hierarchy a little too much. I am afraid to say that it has only gotten worse.\n\nAs recently as 2017, my aunt who has been living in the US for 30 years now, told me to not marry a \"BMW\" girl. My cousins who rebel against my uncle and aunt for so many petty things didn't say a word about it. I felt so awkward and ended up saying something about it to my family but no one seemed to care. A few of those incidents have happened now. While I am disappointed by racist and sexist comments by my family members, it appalls me to see American born Indians staying silent about it. By the way, I have observed the same behavior among many (not all) ABCDesi students I met on campus - this isn't just limited to my family.\n\nBy now most of you are aware of the rape case in Kolkata. The behavior I have observed by Indians online following the incident is sad and disappointing. (I have incredible amount of respect for Indians who participated in a peaceful protest btw). While the story is making headlines on social media, instead of owning up and admitting that it's a shame that an incident like that happened in India and uniting against sexual harassment, most of the responses have been about deflecting the actual issue.\n\n\u201cWomen are worse off in African and Middle Eastern countries.\u201d - So what? Even if true, none of that changes anything about the incident. It just sends a message to Indian women and the rest of the world that Indian men are okay with the rate of rape cases as long as we aren't the worst.  \n\"Not all Indian men are rapist.\" - Yes it's true but response like that is not how you bring a social change. Why are we more concerned about India's image on social media than the safety of our women? Every society is going to have bad apples (living in the US for 15 years and I have seen plenty of their bad apples, but that's not the concern of this post). The way to counter those bad apples isn't to stay silent or say \u201c99% of us are not bad!\", but to own up and shame the predatory behavior. A few million people protesting isn't enough - majority of the citizens must participate to shut down the behavior of those bad apples. Staying silent or saying \"not all of us do it\" is not an option. Either you are part of the solution or you are part of the problem.\n\nAll of the above goes for dismantling discriminatory behavior against particular caste, religion, and race too. Don't get me started on discrimination against Africans or anyone with a dark skin tone in India. Don't justify your behavior with \"Imagine if a Hindu walked in a Muslim neighborhood. It would be much worse.\" Let's just assume that it's true. Just because a minority behaves worse than you in general, it doesn't give you a right to be like them. The hope is that we follow a set of values that lead to safe and prosperous society for all citizens. Maybe other communities won't follow those principles just yet, but someone has to start somewhere and it\u2019s a lot easier if the majority follows those principles first. There are many ways to ruin a society, but only a few ways to build a great one. Until we are deeply divided across caste, race, sex, and religion, we aren't going to earn the respect of our citizens, let alone the respect of the rest of the world. And some people want India to be a \u201cSuper power\u201d.\n\nI want to emphasize this - I know most of us don't engage in discriminatory behavior, at least not publicly. What I am saying is to actively participate in shaming that behavior. Not shaming the person or devaluing them, but calling out their behavior in a civil manner.\n\nAfter contemplating on this for a few years now, what I have realized is that social change is a choice. It's not just going to come for free as we develop economically. There are plenty of countries where citizens are rich but social injustice prevails. To be a prosperous society, we need to choose justice as much as we choose wealth and overall wellbeing.\n\nIn my personal experience, the US has regressed too in the last few years. That\u2019s evident from gross generalization of Indians and other minorities on social media by right wing nationalists, so this rant is no way a defense of other countries. I am just more concerned about my motherland first.\n\nOn a lighter note, if you are already part of the solution, you have my utmost respect and \"Phull Sapport Saar\".\n\nEdit: Their comment got deleted so I can't see their whole comments but I believe the question was \"What do I need to own up to?\". I am guessing your position is that you are not a rapist and you have nothing to feel guilty about. Yes you haven't done anything wrong, but the price we pay for living in a democracy is to cultivate a safe society for all citizens. If you have failed to call out and shame predatory behavior, then you have allowed our society to be unsafe for women. You have to own up at least that much and make a change now. If you have called out and shamed those behaviors, then kudos to you.\n\nEdit 2: I responded to a few of you but looks like my comments aren't showing up \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Anyways... to the person who brought up the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. I care about attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh as much as attacks on minority anywhere else in the world. I specifically am talking about this issue because I am a citizen of a democracy and I have an actual impact over social and political situation in India even if it's just at a small scale. I have no direct control over what Bangladeshi radicals do in their country. I will absolutely expect the Indian government to use whatever influence they have to protect Hindus or any other Indians. Trust me, I know what it's like to be a minority in another country. And as for me liking Islamists, let's just I like humanity. Is your hatred towards muslims aligned with your Hindu Dharma?\n\nEdit 3: Ugh reddit still won't let me reply to people's post. Replying to this comment \"No one loves India more than the person who has moved away from here\". This is a perfect example of deflection. Instead of addressing the issue, let's just make this about an NRI criticizing India. That attitude is the problem. I visit India frequently and may even move to India someday. NRIs moved away because they didn't have good opportunities for themselves in India, but that does not mean they don't care about India. What kind of NRIs do you want? The ones who care and criticize or just leave and forget? If NRIs can't criticize India despite being Indian citizens then stop posting lists of Indian CEOs in the US and claiming them as Indians - can't have it both ways.\n\nLast Edit: Replying to the comment that says that I have just adopted the American koolaid. First of all human rights are ***not*** an American invention. I am critiquing India based on the values my Hindu parents in India taught me. What part of my post doesn't align with Indian values? Does India not want safety for all the citizens regardless of race, religion, caste, or sex? Is India not a democracy where citizens have responsibility for shaping the future of our society and actively participating in condemning predatory behavior that violates human rights? Again stop deflecting the issue by bringing America into this. This is about India and I am critiquing our society based on Indian values (or at least what our constitution says). And I don't need approval from Americans, they have their own set of problems but majority their citizens aren't just sitting around doing nothing about it.\n\nThere are so many comments where people also recognize the issues I am bring up. Thank you for also speaking up and you are the real reason India will be a thriving society someday, not the \"defensive and insecure\" bystanders.", "What game are you playing right now? I\u2019ve been loving dead island 2, platinumed it twice already.", "Not your free baby sitter, thanks for asking though. So I have a distant friend. She is a friend of a friend of a friend type deal. She has 3 kids. I have 3 cats. Ha.\n\nHer kids are enrolled in a camp very close to my house. Pick up for the camp is at 4pm. The line for pickup for the kids is 3pm. Yeah, it can take a really long time to pick up kids at that camp. A big old line of cars form up everyday to get the kiddies. its a bit chaotic.\n\nNow here is the story:\n\nThis Friend of a friend, has been using her \u201clunch breaks\u201d to fetch the kiddies from camp. Sometimes the traffic is sooooo bad she is late getting back to work. I\u2019m not sure if she takes the kids with her to work or drops them off someplace but the situation at work is getting dicey. Her boss is sick of her coming back late.\n\nNow, I live very close to this camp. My house is on the \u201cpick up your kid parade route\u201d these parents are on. oh there are some angry humans waiting to get into that school for those kids. Mark my words!\n\nFriend of a friend has come up with a brilliant idea, in her eyes anyway. She has asked me to go get the kids for her. All 3 of them. She would Like me to take them back to my house, give them a snack or something and wait for her to pick them up. She thinks it will be much easier to fetch them from my house then the camp, since she has to drive into the camp and I can merely walk.\n\nI said no. I am not a baby sitter, I\u2019m not a nanny. I\u2019m an artist I have a job, I work from home but I have a job, I\u2019m not watching 3 kids under the age of 10 for unknown hours and have to provide snacks for them as well.\n\nShe said that she would pay me, 20 bucks to fetch the kids.\n\nI said \u201cNO. I already have 20 bucks, so I\u2019m good.\u201c She does not find this funny, but I sure did.\n\nShe tells me: \u201cshe is a single mom trying to do her best. It takes a village! I am so close to the camp, why can\u2019t I just do this favor for her?\u201d\n\nI say, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not a favor. it\u2019s a job. I already have a job, I work from home, I am an artist. Also, I don\u2019t know your kids. I barely know you. I\u2019m not watching 3 stranger kids for anyone. That is just how that cookie crumbles.\u201d\n\nWell, she is unhappy! Very very unhappy. Her next plan is set into motion: send in the Mommy Group! She gets my friend and few other friends to email and call me. Nothing like a good Mommy Wagon Train to circle around with.\n\nExcept, That doesn\u2019t work either. You see, I\u2019m not in high school,  so the whole peer pressure thing no longer applies to my life. I don\u2019t care if they like me or not. Also, I\u2019m not a human mommy, I\u2019m a fur baby mommy. Other fur baby mommies don\u2019t care about such things. We are a super laid back group in general. We have a pick up your kids poop and I\u2019ll pick up my kids poop policy.\n\nMommy Group made some big points with me: 1. How easy it would be for me to get the kids from the camp. 2. I could do arts and crafts with the kids until mom came and got them. 3. I would not be lonely during the day because I would have kids to play with. 4. It would be a nice thing to do for a single mom who is struggling with a situation right now.\n\nAll really interesting points \u2026. that\u2026 have absolutely no impact on me. Arts and crafts with the kiddies? Are you for real? I don\u2019t do arts and crafts, I sell art for a living. I\u2019m not a freaking Micheal\u2019s. The kids can\u2019t help, I don\u2019t want them too, and my studio some days are a full on wreck. I don\u2019t even let the cats in there on those days. Plus single mommy with 3 kids is driving a new BMW. Perhaps she should have gotten a more economic car and a professional nanny.\n\nI reminded them all that if it was so easy to do this one thing, then they too can get the kids from the camp. Hell, park in my dang driveway if you need be Ladies. Then they can walk in and grab the kids. Take them home and do arts and crafts. Plus friend of a friend  will pay them 20 BUCKS For their trouble. Not sure if that\u2019s for the week or per day but who cares! It\u2019s like printing money at that point! All they have to do is provide the snacks and wait for her to claim the kids!\n\nAlso truly funny reply but still not getting a laugh from the Mommy Group. In fact, I only got stunned silence and I think cricket sounds.  I\u2019m just not hitting my target audience with this humor!\n\nWhelp, it took a while for Friend Of A Friend  to see that I\u2019m not willing to provide child Care for free, for the 20bucks, or for the sake of the village. I also pointed out that my idea of \u201cjuice boxes\u201c is a  Franzia refreshing white carton. And my idea of a snack is waiting until dinner. All points she finds to be unhelpful and not practical.\n\nSadly, friend of a friend Mommy is still racing to get her kids from the camp. Turns out the  Mommy Group folks are just too busy to fetch the kiddies for her Too. Bummer I know. I thought it would be so easy for them. Since they had made such goooooood points about picking them up.\n\nLife moves on, Camp is still swinging, the parade of cars grows longer and slower everyday!\n\nThen today this happened:.\n\nI am inside my house sitting on my couch binging the good, the bad and the ugly of street food venders on You Tube. I hurt my back so I\u2019m leaning on a heating pad. You can see me from my living room window if you are on \u201cthe parade of cars\u201d picking up their kids From the camp. My Feet up on the coffee table, my cats are on porch, my \u201cjuice box\u201c hahah Franzia is to the right of me. ;-)\n\nJust Then, I get a angry text on my phone:\n\n\u201cI thought you said you are working?????? TOOO BUSY TO GET KIDS! LOOKS you\u2019re  just sitting there doing nothing but watch TV! What the hell is the matter with you! WHY CANT YOU BE A BETTER FRIEND!\u201d\n\nOMG! It\u2019s friend of a friend! Neato!\n\nTo which I answer:\n\n\u201cI am working, I\u2019m on my iPad drawing. I am an artist, I can do that. Gee\u2026 ain\u2019t my work grand?  I am too busy to get YOUR kids. It looks like I\u2019m watching TV because I AM WATCHING TV! YouTube: Dancing Bacons, street fair in Malaysia, cool! I highly recommend if you ever get  second to yourself. I hurt my back so that\u2019s what the hell is wrong with me, thanks for asking.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t be a better friend because I don\u2019t want to pick up your kids. I feel like if we got closer and communicated more I would be obligated to fetch your babies. You do see how my way is more convenient \u2026.  for me\u201d\n\nHER: those blasted dancing dot dot dot things on the text chat.\n\nME: Are you sitting in the car out side my house right now?\n\nHer: \\*slight pause\\* YES!!!!!\n\nME: \\*turns around slowly, big old wine glass in my hand\\*. I smile, I wink! I lift the glass! I text: **CHEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSS**! (God, if only I had some pot to light up, now that would have been perfect!)\n\nShe was not amused. Still no laughs. I think I\u2019m losing my touch?\n\nAre you laughing dear reader???\n\nYes, she does know I\u2019m on Reddit. HI!!!!!!!! If you\u2019re  reading this! Thanks for making me laugh today.", "I might be in the minority but I'm not too concerned about the future of Germany. At least, not more than the future of any other western country.\n\nNow, in the recent months there has been a wave of doomerist news about Germany. Energy crisis! Deindustrialization! Fascists! Demographics! Economy! And the country in general has been through better times that's for sure. With that said, I do believe the claims I've been reading on reddit and elsewhere about the future of Germany are kinda wild and a bit dumb.\n\nFirst point, the automotive. I feel 2024 is to the automotive sector what 1974 was to heavy industry: a moment of reckoning. People are quick to say that German brands \"didn't react quickly enough\" to the growth of EVs, but that is not really the case - VW was one of the early adopters, and both BMW and Mercedes are experiencing continued growth in sales. The real issue is multifaceted:\n\n1. Chinese brands have expanded in China, and therefore non-Chinese brands (including VW) have lost much of the Chinese market. They haven't really lost many shares in the European market;\n\n2. China is no longer growing as it used to, as it faces a wave of crises of its own (see the Evergrande collapse), and therefore it stopped being an engine of growth for the entire sector;\n\n3. the entire European/western auto market imploded after Covid, with the inflation and the fact that cars just aren't a status symbol any longer as they used to be for previous generations.\n\nThis is hitting auto manufacturers in all countries. [Hyundai](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hyundai-motor-shut-south-korean-parts-plants-pivot-toward-evs-2023-12-21/) is closing factories in Korea while [Honda and Toyota](https://www.ft.com/content/2a07fe5c-53fd-46ee-ab1e-670ed36ed19e) are seeing a plunge in profits. Japanese car makers are also notoriously behind in the EV transition. And even Tesla's margins are eroding as Tesla no longer has the competitive edge it used to have as a pioneer. Even *chinese brands within China* are struggling, especially since BYD has exploded circa 2022. The EV industry is in itself much less labour intensive than the normal IC industry, which means that a restructuring is inevitable even in the best managed company, and even more so in a company like VW which is a bit overbloated.\n\nThat doesn't mean the end of Germany as we know it. Cars make up about 8-9% of Germany's exports. Countries went through entire industrial restructurings and lived to tell the tale. In the 80s everyone was panicking because Japan would buy us all. In the end, we survived.\n\nGermany itself has been dismissed so many times before. It lived through the end of coal in the 1970s, it lived through the annexation of poor postindustrial soviet states and masses of unemployment in the 1990s, it lived through the competitiveness crisis of the early 00s and the global financial crisis, and IMHO it will live through the current car crisis. It seems worse now because Germany never really had to face the same impact that e.g. the US had to face, and it didn't lose 25-30% of its industry in one go as France or Italy did in 2008.\n\nAlso, as much as Germany's energy policies are criticised, [the share of renewables keeps growing](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-57-germanys-electricity-consumption-first-half-2024) and electricity prices are [back to where they were in 2021](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/electricity-price). Additionally, while unemployment is creeping up from its historical lows, [employment is still at its highest level ever](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/employment-rate). [Migration is also surging](https://recruitonomics.com/net-migration-surges-but-germanys-still-missing-skilled-workers/), which might be controversial for some, but still shows that Germany is a migration magnet despite its various shortfalls in integration, digitalisation, bureaucracy, and language facilities.\n\nEven the economy [has only been stagnating for a year and a half](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth-annual), which is not positive by any means, but it's also not the absolute economic catastrophe that some seem to be describing.\n\n[Germany's productivity growth has been among the highest outside the US](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_PDB%40DF_PDB_LV&df[ag]=OECD.SDD.TPS&df[vs]=1.0&dq=.A.GDPHRS..USD_PPP_H.Q...&pd=2007%2C&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=tb) in the past 15 years, despite having modestly stalled in 2023. [Same goes for average real wages](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C1%7CEmployment%23JOB%23%7CBenefits%252C%20earnings%20and%20wages%23JOB_BW%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=21&vw=tb&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_EARNINGS%40AV_AN_WAGE&df[ag]=OECD.ELS.SAE&df[vs]=1.0&dq=..USD_PPP..Q..&pd=2000%2C&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false). And this was achieved with sound finances - the country still maintains a triple A rating, which means its bonds are globally seen as an extremely safe investment, which in turn means Germany can finance itself at extremely favourable rates.\n\nThere ARE huge problems - demographics being the number one, although as I mentioned previously, Germany is still attracting loads of migrants so it can at least soften the blow whereas countries like Korea, Japan or Italy or even China will just crash. Or under-investment which is showing in the state of regional trains (public transit in cities is still great IMHO, although it's starting to wear). Or the slow pace of digitalisation. Still, under-investment is a much easier problem to solve than overindebtedness when you're one of the richest countries in the world and can start investing more whenever you want.\n\nFinally, about Fascism. Western Germany, when you look at the numbers, is actually one of the areas in the developed world where extremists are *least* successful. At least that's true currently, no idea about the next 10 years, but again, it's not like any other country is faring any better in that respect.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying the future in Germany will be made of gold and smell of roses. But I also don't think it warrants the sort of extreme doom and gloom that I've been reading. Overall, I think Germany is heading for some overdue restructuring, and it will have to face some structural issues, but it will still be mostly fine.\n\nIf you truly want to look at a country that is majorly, royally f-ed, look at Russia. For a richer, more western example, look at Italy.", "BMW i5 delivery delayed. Are you impacted ? BMW says about 1.5 million of its cars are affected by problems with a braking system made by Continental, a leading supplier of automotive components. About 1.2 million of those vehicles have already been delivered to clients and are being checked by BMW remotely using over-the-air software. Delivery of the remaining 320,000 has been frozen.\n\nMine also got delayed for indefinite time(because my car dealer hasn\u2019t given me any dates yet).\n\nIs anybody else effected by this??? Does anyone know how long this will take?", "Why I sold my Tesla Model 3 Performance & went back to gas I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a \"paid big oil shill\" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.\n\nEverything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.\n\nAnd yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.\n\n# EV performance & its accessibility\n\nI'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the \"pure acceleration\" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.\n\nAnd how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of \"stuff\" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama.\n\n# Electric motors are great\n\nAnd all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to \"break\" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better.\n\nAND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full \"throttle\" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.)\n\n# Convenience & running costs\n\nYou can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either. True, the suspension, brakes, thermal management gubbins, etc., are largely synonymous between an EV and ICE. But when it comes to the actual propulsion, there's basically zero wear and tear. Just a dumb motor that doesn't care about much, and will probably last well past 1 million miles. With a new battery, you're basically looking at a brand-new drivetrain.\n\nAnd yes, running on electricity is cheaper than filling up an ICE car - this is where most of the EV \"savings\" materialize. In my experience, electricity in the mid-Atlantic region cost roughly 12\u00a2/kWh and 9\u00a2/kWh in the PNW. For my TM3P, that equates to about $10 and $8 in each region, respectively, to travel \\~265 miles, assuming: A 75 kWh battery pack, lifetime consumption average of 280 Wh/mile, and a 13% charging loss, **IF** you can charge at home (which is key to the \"get in and go\" convenience of an EV - without that, forget it). Subtract oil + filter changes, spark plugs, failing chain tensioners, bad oxygen sensors, burnt out cat converters, and other annoying problems, and the running costs quickly stack up in the EV's favor. You rarely even use the brakes! Even with the initial purchase price of an EV still being notably higher than gasoline, on average, you can make the argument that it still comes out cheaper in the long run. But the wildcard here is \"how long is 'long run?'\"\n\nThe cost of battery pack replacement isn't discussed as often as I'd like. Some of the earliest Model S packs are already starting to fail - only about 10 years later. When I sold my E46, it was approaching 20 years old. It still faithfully serves its new owner on a daily basis, today. Maybe I've only heard about the edge cases, and the Model 3's will all last considerably last longer, but I personally never got comfortable being part of a beta test. The batteries in these cars remain a delicate subject, which brings us to the poo-poo part of this post.\n\n# Let's face it - batteries still suck.\n\nElectric motors are one thing; powering them is an entirely different story. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are really the only currently viable way to power EVs en masse. Part of what makes them great is that they're extremely efficient when it comes to storing and dispensing energy - especially compared to fossil fuels and other solutions in the works. You put electricity in, electricity comes back out. The leap from energy generation to use is extremely short. But they do have notable limitations around longevity, performance, and cost, especially when it comes to shuffling a 2+ ton vehicle around. Whether you're willing to accept these limitations is up to you.\n\n**Degradation is inevitable**\n\nAt this point, the oldest Model Ss on the road at about 10 years old. Although the Model 3 pack is newer and has less cells (thus less to go wrong - 7,920 in the Plaid vs 4,416 in a TM3 LR), we don't yet have enough information to truly know what to expect from these packs from a longevity perspective. Unlikely that Tesla will ever share this info, either. If Elon is to be believed, the Model 3 pack should last 300,000 - 500,000 miles. If Elon is to be believed, fully-autonomous cars would've been shuffling us around long before 2020. We know that with proper care, pretty much any modern ICE car should be able to surpass the 250,000 mile mark without many problems. So anyone who likes to run their cars for as long as possible and buys an EV should know that they're venturing into the unknown.\n\nYes, I'm aware that there are examples out there of Model Ss surpassing several hundred thousand miles - with the caveat being that a not-insignificant number of them of them involved battery and/or drive unit replacements at various points. There are also Hyundai Elantras out there with 1,000,000+ miles on their original powertrains.\n\nBut note that degradation is only one part of the story. Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another. Yes, the internet is a fantastic place for angry people to vent, and it could be that the population's negatively skewed - like the Finnish guy who recently blew up his Model S on YouTube. But the reality is that if one single cell - not brick, not module, but **cell** \\- fails, the pack is done. That cell turns into a parasite. The car will struggle and ultimately fail to balance out the pack, eventually giving up one morning, telling you to GFY, and to take it to Tesla. Last I heard, replacing the battery on a Model S was \\~$24,000 and \\~$16,000 for a Model 3. This is just one type of sudden pack failure that I've heard about, and what makes it especially concerning is that the root cause seems fairly trivial relative to the catastrophe that ensues. Maybe it's overblown and maybe I'm being paranoid, but the chances of this happening are real, and only increase in with age...\n\n...which is something else that affects battery degradation, as indicated by Tesla's latest shenanigan of selling \"new\" cars with batteries from 4+ year-old stock, claiming that range \"may be reduced by 12%.\" (At the time of this writing: Model 3 SR drive unit + battery warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, LR is 8 years/120,000 miles). So yes, the car is literally getting worse every day by the sheer virtue of just sitting there - especially in extreme climates. How pronounced is the impact of age vs. use vs. fast-charging is anybody's guess, but it's a reality that needs to be acknowledged.\n\nSo if you're comfortable with basically ending up with a 2 - 3 ton paperweight if some electrical fault appears in the pack, and have the means to shovel cash into the Tesla furnace without much concern for what the future may hold, then you're probably less worried about the battery. I envy your fortitude and tolerance for risk - it's something I thought I could swallow, but couldn't. As I learned these realities, I became increasingly less comfortable with the prospect of keeping the car past its warranty period. Yes, an ICE can also fail (a timeworn Tesla fanatic argument), but not many ICE failures end in the car being completely inoperable - especially in modern cars which are ridiculously reliable and serviceable by anyone.\n\n**Mitigation means sacrifice**\n\nIf you want the battery to last as long as possible, you have to be nice to it.\n\nYou don't want to leave the battery fully-charged for extended periods of time, or let it drop below 10% - there are arguments that doing either of these is more detrimental to battery longevity than supercharging. But this is why the 90 - 100% block on a Tesla's charge indicator is labeled \"Trip.\" (I don't think any other manufacturers do this... And part of me wonders whether it's a Teslan strategy to maximize rated range.) So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health. It's OK to charge to 100% right before a long trip, but the lower, the better, around town. There are people who charge to 90%, 80%, or even lower on a daily basis as a result. Jeff Dahn recommends 70% to maximize life - you can look him up. Now, paying $50K+ for a vehicle like this and running it below its potential for most of its life just... sucks. Especially seeing as the car produces its maximum power output only at about 90%+ state of charge (SoC).\n\nThat's right. Until they develop a battery that behaves like it's filled with a liquid, this is going to remain a reality. Batteries are only at their best when they're charged to 90 - 100% of their capacity. This becomes especially noticeable at highway speeds at a low SoC, since EVs accelerate far more brutally from a stop than from a roll. The car is still **plenty** quick on the highway, but this does result in some ass-clenching moments when passing cars on a divided yellow and you're used to driving around in God Mode. You put your foot down at <30% SoC @ 55 mph, expecting one response, but get quite another. (Disclaimer: Although this is a battery reality, it's also a byproduct of the car having a single gear - no motor can rev to infinity.)\n\nBatteries also do *not* like extreme temperature. Batteries are like people - they're most comfortable at the temperatures we're most comfortable - right around 70\u00b0F. This impacts **both** their output and charging. So in the cold, they do not want to charge, and they do not want to give you full power. When it's *extremely* cold, expect to lose 30 - 40% of your range thanks to this convenient little truth, combined with the fact that you're probably running the heat. In lower temperatures, my Model 3's \"acceleration/regen\" indicator frequently told me that the car was both power-limited and/or regen-limited because of a cold-soaked battery. What does \"cold\" mean? I don't know - and seems to change with software updates. Towards the end of my ownership, it seemed that the car sitting overnight in the high 40s/low 50s was enough to result in power limiting to protect the battery. Preheating the car before departure mitigates this problem, which eats into your range unless you're plugged in. (Note that Tesla also recently updated the Model 3 with a heat pump vs. a resistive heater, which sounds like it's notably helped with cold weather driving range. However, initial accounts of how this affects cold weather power output were mixed, as cabin HVAC and battery were both effectively \"competing\" for scavenging what little heat was available. Whether or not these problems have since been remedied, I'm not sure.)\n\n**Performance (with caveats)**\n\nExcessive heat also presents problems. Since an ICE vehicle's engine is operating at about 212\u00b0F, the ambient temperature differential is generally more than enough to provide cooling. Even temps of 100\u00b0F+ provide plenty of space to act as a sink. But when \"hot\" is closer to \\~120\u00b0F, as in for a Li-ion battery, things get a bit more challenging. Obviously this won't be a relevant problem for 99.98% of people, but it is an issue if you're planning on sustained high-performance driving. I think the problem is \\*almost\\* solved through aftermarket components like larger radiators and auxiliary cooling pumps, but as of my leaving the community a number of months ago, it was still an issue for the Model 3, even in cooler temperatures. (Whether they've solved this with the Plaid, I'm not sure - I don't know if anyone's been able to run it for long enough prior to overcooking the horribly insufficient brakes and/or tires.) And if you are planning on tracking your Model 3, anticipate something like <60 miles of track driving range because of an EV's sensitivity to stress, and the simple fact that the car isn't really carrying that much energy on board.\n\nLook up Jason Fenske's Engineering Explained video on battery density on YouTube for an excellent explanation of this. It boils down to the fact that a gallon of gasoline has roughly 13x the energy density than the best of modern Li-ion batteries by volume - and we're strictly talking about the cells here. I.e., it doesn't take into account the fact that there are a lot of other things that need to surround those cells to get them to actually do their job in an EV. The battery pack in a Long Range Model 3 weighs roughly 1,000 lbs... All of the energy contained within equates to roughly 2.2 gallons of gasoline. Which also has the added benefit of being extremely portable, should you find yourself off the beaten path. Try carrying that much energy in batteries by hand... Hope you brought a spare car.\n\nBut that's not the entire story. Yes, EVs do put more of that energy into forward motion than an ICE. But this excellent efficiency is also precisely the reason why EV racing isn't going to approach the length of conventional races any time soon. I'm too dumb to explain it in mathematical terms, but since EVs are so efficient, every \"stressor\" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle. The best ICE engines on the road today are something like 35 - 40% efficient, which means that 60 - 65% of the energy in the fuel is basically wasted as heat vs. propulsion. So any kind of \"fast\" or aggressive driving is going to have an exponential impact on an EV's range.\n\nI *never* saw the quoted \"310 miles of range\" that's on the sticker of the Model 3 - and this was on the standard, hateful 18\" MXM4s that came with the car. At one point I ran into a former colleague at my local Tesla service center who was there to discuss that very issue - \"I'm not getting 300+ miles on the highway?\" Yep. The girl at the counter told him the same thing. \"That's normal - anything above 70 MPH is going to dramatically decrease your range.\" If you look on the forums, generally speaking, the lifetime average consumption that many people are getting hovers around 280 Wh/mile. If you drive like a nance, this number will obviously improve, but if you're on this forum... I'm guessing you drive a bit more spiritedly than that.\n\nTo accommodate said spirited driving, I decided to up the car's OEM 235 tires (that's what the new Civic SI comes with, except it's 1,200 lbs lighter) to 265 PS4Ss and installed a set of KW coilovers. As a result of the aforementioned sensitivity, I knew my range would take a hit... but I wasn't quite prepared for how much. One morning while taking my wife to the airport, I said \"ok, I'm just going to drive this like I used to drive the BMW.\" Temps were in the upper 40s/lower 50s, heated seats on, cabin heat on low, averaging 70-ish mph on the highway with one passenger + her luggage. On return, I calculated that my range would've come out to roughly **200 miles.** As many Tesla evangelists would argue, \"well, dass enuff range\" and sure, in most situations, that's probably true. But for me, personally, this added another layer of  anxiety that made any form of enthusiastic driving feel like a sin. There are rumors out there that the Model 3 was literally designed around the wheels and tires, and after experiencing that, I'm inclined to believe it.\n\nSo when people talk about using EVs to tow over extended distances, I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna fly. Especially with heavy/large loads, and considering that such vehicles will need charging stations spacious enough to accommodate them on long-haul trips. And I don't care about this \"o well X% of people don't tow past Y miles.\" I just don't. EV forums are filled with tiresome \"oh you don't need that\" arguments that are somehow supposed to enshroud the fact that for many people, an EV would result in a step backwards when it comes to utility. Anyway, that brings us to everyone's favorite subject - charging infrastructure!\n\n# Do you have a place to charge?\n\nAt the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla. And this is assuming you're sticking to generally well-traveled paths in fair-weather conditions. That's because when you buy a Tesla, you're also buying into their supercharger network. The whole experience is generally pretty good - you simply drive up to the charger, plug in your car, and that's it. (Admittedly, I don't have experience with any other EV fast charging, but from what I've heard and seen, it's spotty, at best.)\n\nWhen you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little \"unique,\" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'. Expect your \"real\" range in a big-battery Model 3 to be more like \\~250 miles on the OEM wheels and tires in good weather. It's true that the car will most likely beat 310 miles in city driving, where EV range is amazing, but that's quite a narrow use case that would take literally all day. Then again, I never actually heard of anyone \"running out of battery\" on the road (in which case your only recourse is to tow the car), but it is a little uncomfortable to read about various close calls, like people trying to keep their families from freezing to death in 10\u00b0F weather with the heater sucking down 3 kW, sitting in 3+ hours of traffic. The car does its damndest to keep you from running out, though, triggering warnings to reduce your speed or telling you that you're driving into a \"supercharger desert\" if it calculates that you're living on the edge.\n\nSo if you do end up traveling into a supercharger desert, with only third-party and destination chargers to rely on, you have to be prepared to ask yourself several questions:\n\n1. Is there charging?\n2. Is it accessible to you? Or is it purely for clients of an establishment, etc.?\n3. Is it compatible? Different standards *do* exist, which is genuinely infuriating if we're gonna get serious about electrified personal transport. This isn't a fucking cellphone. As far as I know, third-party fast charging for Teslas is either sketchy at the moment, or nowhere near as powerful as a 150+ kW supercharger. (By the way, melting a J1772 adapter for a Tesla at any third-party chargers is not uncommon. Ask me how I know.)\n4. Is it powerful enough to get you the range you need in the time you have to charge?\n5. Are you willing to pay the price? A lot of these places are no longer free. Some cost a ridiculous amount for simple Level 2 charging, which is basically like someone asking you to pay for using a dryer outlet.\n6. Is it even going to be available? If it's open parking or it's saturated with other EVs, you might have to wait. If it's Level 2, you're probably doomed.\n\nOnly if you can answer \"Yes\" to those with confidence are you good-to-go. And while it's true that the \"gas savings\" are real, many people don't seem to be factoring in the charging losses I mentioned earlier. Estimate 10 - 15% losses for charging, meaning that you're consuming more electricity than what actually makes it into the pack. These charging losses get worse in extreme temperatures - up to 40% in cold weather. You still come out ahead, but it's an important fact to note if we're going to be honest with ourselves. And the assumption underpinning that argument is always that you are charging at home - a reality that only exists for something like 40% of the American driving public. Charging at a supercharger costs more.\n\nEven if fast-charging the battery wasn't detrimental to its health, it's not like there's a supercharging station on every corner. Building superchargers costs a lot of money, it's not as simple as just \"tapping into the local supercharger line.\" You'll notice that at every station, there's huge enclosed devices turning massive amounts of electricity into DC power. I've heard that Tesla doesn't run these as profit centers, and I do think the pricing to supercharge is very reasonable, but it's still not free (unless you get this incentive) - so charging at a supercharger costs roughly the same in \"fuel\" as driving an econobox.\n\nAnd as batteries continue getting better and better, as they will, keep in mind that a kWh of energy is a kWh of energy. A theoretical 1 MW pack in a theoretical Tesla semi is going to need a supercharger that outputs about 4x the power of today's fastest superchargers to get to where it's going in any reasonable amount of time. If we imagine some super magic battery that's 50 MW and weighs 1 ton, it's not like you'll be able to charge that on a dryer outlet. You need serious power infrastructure on the other side of that battery to make it practical. I'd imagine that powering sustained commercial flight someday, for example, would basically require airports build their own dedicated power plants. Admittedly I have no clue how difficult or easy this is, but I'm sure there's an army of electrical engineers frothing at the keyboard to add to this point.\n\n# From an enthusiast's perspective...\n\nI've already scratched the surface of this, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about my TM3P strictly from an enthusiast's standpoint. There's a lot of stereotypes out there about Tesla owners, and while it is true that many of them have never seen a flathead screwdriver, there's also a substantial number of them coming from high-performance BMWs, Porsche 911s, Dodge Hellcats, McLarens, etc. A good number of them claim that the TM3P is the \"most fun\" car they've ever owned, and that's great, but I guess fun means different things to different people.\n\nI genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver. I can't quite put my finger on the root of it - I think it's some combination of no noise, no gears, not using the brakes 98% of the time, and the experience of owning a car that basically does everything for you. For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been *some* part of the reward. And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really \"looked forward\" to driving it. It was  such a seamless and uninvolving experience that it just kind of faded into the background as a simple means to an end, rather than something engaging and fun to look forward to.\n\nAnd it's not for lack of capability. With coilovers, sways, various control arms, and wheels + tires, my TM3P was razor sharp and scary quick in any given situation. At auto-xs, I was able to hang with seasoned veterans driving Cayman GT4s equipped with track tires. But even then, as I was getting thrown about the cabin on the sofa-like seat (seriously - most comfortable seats of any car I've ever driven), I couldn't help but feel that something was still missing, and it runs deeper than the difference between \"fun\" and \"exciting.\"\n\nI don't think it's necessarily down to the fact that I grew up driving with both hands and both feet. A while ago I got a Hyundai Kona AWD as a rental. I had a ton of fun throwing that thing around... maybe more fun than I'd ever had in my Tesla. (As Jeremy Clarkson says - the fastest car in the world is the rental car.) Coming to this tragic realization was a big red flag for me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, at \\~4,100 lbs, it's still a a fat-ass car, and the weight was an ever-present part of the experience? Or it starts life as a comfortable family sedan? But then again, so does the M3. I can't for sure pin it down to one thing, but at the end of the day I never really \"felt\" and enjoyed the Tesla in the same way I felt and enjoyed my '99 Miata.\n\n# Tesla and the EV community\n\nThis is the part where I rage about Tesla and will probably ruffle some feathers. Too bad.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the service center (SC) employees are generally awesome - at least the one in my local SC. Tesla's engineers are brilliant, too. And it's refreshing to see a novel approach to building a car, where all the systems are so tightly integrated that everything feels \"whole\" vs. a bunch of different fiefdoms colliding into one car at the very end. And they're truly being innovative beyond just the fact that they're making EVs - Elon's woken up to the fact that manufacturing is no joke, and it sounds like they're doing their damnedest to make strides in this area as well. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately their innovations in manufacturing outweigh their innovations everywhere else.\n\nBut I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.\n\nTheir quality control is abhorrent - we already know that. Model Ys being delivered with windshields not bonded into place is my favorite recent example. But the materials themselves are nothing to write home about, either. It's not bargain-basement bad, but the Model 3/Y certainly do *not* feel like $45K+ cars, except to clueless new owners who are just getting interested in cars for the first time. This really hit home for me the first time I cleaned my Model 3's interior - the carpets are literally like a glorified version of glovebox liner. The lauded \"vegan leather\" seats don't seem so great, either - look up the headrest bubbling issue on the Model 3. Which is an excellent segue into the mentality of \\*some\\* Tesla fanatics.\n\nBefore we dive into this, let's be clear - The **vast** majority of owners, as usual, are just normal people who don't care. Every car brand has its own subset of narrow-minded insufferable people who will die defending it, no matter what. What makes this subset of Tesla peeps especially unbearable is that they genuinely believe that they are saving the planet and have elevated Tesla to something more of a deity than a car company. So there's this undercurrent of holiness that accompanies the entire sphere and makes the proselytizing that much more infuriating. *\"Ew, ICE engines, what a stupid design!\"* Yeah. Our civilization got to where it is on AAA batteries!\n\nBut that's easy to ignore. The copious amounts of mental gymnastics going on in the community is what's truly saddening. I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.\n\nI came across countless other such examples where fashionable forfeiture serves as justification for buying into a nascent technology - \"Who needs to drive more than 200 miles, anyway?\" False analogies are rampant, also - \"ICE cars overheat too!\" - often in irrelevant comparisons largely due to being an established technology. There was one guy who was worried about using the heat in the wintertime and its impact on range. Someone replied and told him that he wasn't dressing appropriately for the weather.\n\nBack to the vegan leather headrest, otherwise known as \"plastic.\" (It's hilarious watching two camps of environmentalists collide - on one end, the bovine enthusiasts. On the other, the guys thinking they're saving the planet in a $100K+ EV carrying around 1,300 lbs+ in batteries.) Something similar started happening to mine, both on driver and passenger sides. Getting it replaced under warranty is hit and miss, because Tesla. According to this vocal minority in the Tesla community, it was, of course, my fault. Not that I'd damaged it intentionally, but that \"some hair products tend to do this\" (hint: I use none) or \"some people's body oils degrade car interiors\" (hint: No car I've ever owned has exhibited this problem, ever. Wife is a completely different race from me, same issue - the fact that I even feel the need mention this is ridiculous). One guy went as far as telling me that the problem was that I was using the headrest as a headrest. OK!\n\nEV blogs like electrek and insideEVs are especially abhorrent. Even as a new owner in my honeymoon phase, I stopped reading those a few months into my ownership. Articles are not written from the perspective of \"is Tesla great?\" but rather \"how great is Tesla, exactly?\"\n\nServicing a Tesla is also an exercise in patience. A number of crucial components like batteries and drive units are \"restricted.\" As a DIYer who keeps cars for a long time, this is extremely concerning in the way of Right to Repair. Rich Rebuilds goes on about this. But the company is in no rush to build and support an ecosystem of third-party repair, beyond bullshit like rotating tires. With any other regular car, there's an army of mechanics waiting to serve you should you run into problems.\n\nFinally, the whole \"software as a car\" thing is great - up to a point. It's sort of a double-edged sword. Towards the end of my ownership, my Model 3 started developing this strange intermittent bug that wouldn't let the car go to sleep. So it would inexplicably rip through 1.5% of its battery every hour, just sitting there in the parking lot. No way to tell this was happening. I'd just get into the car the next day and see that the range had gone down considerably overnight. Seeing that issue develop and become increasingly common was very concerning, especially knowing the entropy that can accompany the software lifecycle and Tesla's QC standards. It's one thing to have a bug in your nav, it's quite another when a bug can affect its fundamental operation as A CAR. And with OTA updates, don't assume that just because something works today, it will also work tomorrow. So even though the car is absolutely brilliant in the snow, I never took it skiing, for fear of returning to not only a cold-soaked battery, but also a surprise decrease in available range.\n\nAnd let's not even get into Full Self-Driving. Anyone who thinks that **truly** self-driving cars are anywhere on this side of 50 years will be sorely disappointed. I genuinely feel for the people plopping down $10K for this feature and hope it's mere pocket change in their world.\n\nAnd the yoke? lol\n\n# It's up to you.\n\nIf the downsides that I've laid out here are within your tolerance limits, and you're willing to bear the risk of being an early adopter, nobody can fault you for going with a BEV if it fits your lifestyle and needs. The Model 3, at the end of the day, is still a fantastic car for regular daily driving, for a lot of people.\n\nDo I think this is the end of EVs for me? No. Maybe for the time being, but I think that in 15 - 20 years, there will be far more well-rounded EVs on the market - battery or otherwise. The potential benefits purely from an ownership/convenience perspective are too great to ignore. And I do think that with their skateboard design, allowing them to \"circumvent\" the pedestrian safety regulations that have absolutely ruined the aesthetics of modern cars, EVs also have the potential to make cars beautiful again.\n\nI went into my Model 3 ownership experience with an open mind, and I genuinely learned a lot and have absolutely zero regrets about my experience. But in the end, I couldn't overlook its shortcomings, as I perceived them, for one simple reason: I just never fell in love with it. For you, things might be different.\n\nHappy New Year and let the internet rage begin!", "Many BMW sedans sold in the USA are made in Mexico, and  the rest are made in Germany.  Impact of tariffs?

I drive a 2023 EV6 and have been an EV enthusiast for years so I know that if I want the most efficient charging experience I should use the 350kw units. As I pulled in I see a beautiful 2023 BMW iX on the 150 unit with the chademo plug with the hypercharger stalls open. I pulled into my 350 and (surprise) charged on 1st attempt at full max speeds. \n\nThe woman in the iX was on the phone and appeared very frustrated. She then got in her car and moved to the 350 next to me. She then tried multiple times to get it to work, using her app, her credit card, and eventually broke down in tears because she couldn't figure it out. Her husband has been on the phone and was yelling at her because she couldn't figure it out. I stepped over and offered to help her out. She was flustered but agreed to let me try to help her. I had her unplug and reset her EA app. Within 5 minutes I had her charging. She was essentially doing things in the wrong order and the station was timing out every time. She had been trying to charge for over 30 minutes, had trued all the stalls and couldn't figure it out.\n\nI bring this all up to remind the folks in this sub that we need to be the facilitators of change and help anyone we see having issues getting their cars to charge. Many of the new EV owners don't really know what they're doing, and having a negative experience on their 1st charging session not at home can impact their longterm views on EVs. Be kind and help these folks whenever possible.", "Some considerations to keep in mind if you\u2019re thinking about buying an EV Hi Everyone,\n\nSaw a lot of strong opinions about EVs but I also think that means some need to be better informed on EVs. Since this sub also include Electric Vehicles, why not share some of my knowledge so everyone can benefit.  \nEDIT: ***Since there are quite a lot of commenters who seems to be genuinely interested, I am happy to answer any questions regarding EV ownership based on my experience. Ask away!***\n\n**1. Charging.**  \nIf you have a 10amp normal household powerpoint at home where you park, you are set for at least 150 kms of daily drive. Yeah, no need to worry about \"installing a charger\". If you want to, you can get an electrician to install a 20 amp, 32 amp or even 3 phase charger. But yeah, 10 amp socket is more than enough. Some will be able to get away with charging outside their home, but your experience may vary.\n\n**2. Fast Charging.**\n\nWe don't need to charge like ICE cars fuelling up. **Fast DC charging is only needed if you do road trips.** That is when you usually charge between 10-80% or if your car smart enough, it will tell you when to continue your trip. In my case, all my road trips duration so far is on par or even shorter than my friends using ICE. Why? Because I don't have to stand around holding the fuel hose. With the time I spent on charging , I can do something else. ICE cars user will need to stand holding the hose, line up to pay, move the car and then you can do your toilet breaks etc.\n\n**3.  Battery life**\n\nI will say maybe 10-15 years ago, I wont buy an EV. However, battery technology nowadays is much more advanced and you don't really have to worry about replacing your batteries. The LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries are rated for **3000-5000 charge cycles, which will translate to 1.2 million to 2 million kms** with **only around 20% degradation**. You will be long gone before the battery cark it. Most manufacturers will offer between 8-10 years warranty on battery and drive trains. Any issues with yours will show during the warranty period. So I personally have nothing to worry about.\n\n**4. Is it really cheaper?**  \nI am not here to give you financial advice. But what I know is, some energy providers will give you a time slot where you can charge for 8\u00a2 per kw (For a Tesla Model Y RWD, that will equate to around AU$ 1.2 per 100kms) or some will also give you $0 time slot, usually between 11AM-2 PM during peak electricity production.  \nYou can definitely drive thousands of kms with zero electricity bill.\n\nCurrent EV leasing deal from the government is really making it even cheaper. But you can decide on your own financial decision.\n\n**5. Does it really dont need servicing?**\n\nRegular service? Not for Teslas. Other manufacturers does for whatever reason. The only thing I regularly top up is the Wiper Fluids. Buy it from the shop, $5 a year or so. No other fluid to change or top up regularly. Brake pads will wear out much less than ICE because EVs are also using regen braking. Some EVs I know were on their original pads and disc 3-4 years down the track. You can do optional check up with the mechanics but that's about it. For tyres, yeah same as other cars. The thing about it being heavier, well, not really. A 2024 BMW 3 series kerb weight is 1,770 kgs, a Tesla model 3 2024 kerb weight is 1,761 kgs. Put it this way, I have the same wear rate between my old ICE car and my current EV.\n\n**6. Towing**\n\nEVs can tow. The range will be impacted. But if you do long road trips, that means more stops. That's all.\n\n**7. How about fire?**  \nLFP batteries basically just hit the EV Battery grail, where it was tested by piercing it through with a sharp metal, and the battery only go up to 60 degrees celsius. The risk is now significantly lower. From the resources I found, here is the summary.\n\nLink: https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/how-many-electric-cars-catch-fire-every-year-94313#:\\~:text=To%20put%20that%20figure%20into,2010%2C%20according%20to%20EV%20FireSafe.\n\n>*To December 2023,* ***there were six reported and verified electric car fires in Australia since 2010***\\*, according to EV FireSafe.\\*\n\n>*Those fires,* ***caused by battery abuse, were the result of arson (one incident), external fire (structure burnt down around the EV, three incidents), collision (one incident) and road debris (one incident)****.*", "Why is Grab constantly pushing fees to consumers?

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--> Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

This guy behind me is in a black bmw, and he is on my ass the whole time.   I see him checking his phone, then making angry faces at me and getting closer and closer.  I speed up a bit, thinking it might calm him down.  5 over, nope.  Anyway, I make the first turn, and am now on the street where my building is, maybe 600 yards up ahead.

I remember thinking to myself I need to slow down for this speed bump, and looking back and thinking, if I hit my brakes, this guy is going to hit me..  The plan takes shape in my mind and I speed up.. \n\nI am doing about 45 when I hit that speed bump, and yeehaw..  I did a bit of a jump and land, never once touching my brakes.  Didn't even tap them.  I gave him zero warning for what was about to happen.  \n\nI am watching my rear-view window intensely during this because I wanted to see his reaction.  He was cradling his cell phone between his ear and shoulder when he hit.  His hood bucked up behind me, then slams to the ground.  I see him go flying out of his seat straight up.  He slams his head on the roof of his bmw and his head rolls sideways from impact.  Then he slams back into his seat violently.  He has a total \"wtf was that\" look on his face as he grabs the wheel with both hands to recover.\n\n... and yes, he slowed right the fuck down after that.", "Delhi also needs to talk about responsibile driving.

Only M cars require break in service. \n\nB58 are great engines, overall reliable. Early models had issues with oil filters getting stuck in the housing and housing leaking coolant, not that common though, also crankcase vent valve going bad/making noise. \nLater models have issues with water pump leaking (mainly G05). \n \nB48 overall good engine similar issues as B58, coolant leaks, from oil filter housing, coolant vent pipe. Engine mounts wearing out at relatively low miles 30-50k miles. \n\nLot of complaints for driver\u2019s assistance system, most of the time it\u2019s user error or damage to sensors/modules. Also Bluetooth issues, 50/50 it\u2019s the paired phone issue or software error. Very rarely it\u2019s a hardware issue. \n\nCommon issues across all models is radiator blinds (upper and lower) causing check engine light, sometimes it\u2019s impact damage, sometimes it\u2019s defective part. Also NVLD pressure switch, related to fuel tank ventilation. \n\nS55/F80/f82, I\u2019ve personally never seen the crank hub issues. Stock I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have an issue, heavily\nModded I start considering getting the hub fix. Don\u2019t see many issues with the s55, fairly reliable. \n\nN55 great engine across all platforms. No major issues. I\u2019ve never replaced a N55 engine, never seen rod bearing issues. \n\nOil services, if vehicle is under warranty I\u2019d just stick to the service intervals, out of warranty/higher mileage I\u2019d start doing the oil changes more often 7-8k miles. \n\nEVs have a lot of charging complaints, most of the time it\u2019s user error or the charging station issue. \n\n2023+ and newer models, the curved displayed has issues, Bluetooth issues, SOS malfunction error. \n\nG80/82- S58, don\u2019t see many issues with the engines/driveline. See more interior issues like seat leather coming apart. \n\nG12 N63t/b pretty good but personally I\u2019d get the b58. A lot of issues with the air springs leaking, sunroof creaking noises. \n\nG05, issues with shark fin leaking water into the TCB causing sos malfunction. Later model B58 coolant pump leaking. \n\nAll engines I\u2019d recommend an oil analysis test at higher mileage 50k+ if your concern about longevity. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019d personally stay away from all diesel vehicles, all the emission related components tend to cause a lot of issues and cost a LOT to repair. If you own a diesel my recommendation is drive it really hard maybe a couple times a month. Seen a few N57 timing chain issues on 100k miles engines. \n\nMy favorite platform right now is a G01 with B58. Amazing car to drive. \n\nMy all time favorite BMW is a 1M. \n\nTo be continued\u2026.\n", "When it comes to Dwayne Johnson\u2019s filmography, his films that feature wildly sweaty performances (Fast Five, The Rundown, Pain & Gain) have higher critic and user averages than his less sweaty performances. This isn\u2019t great for Red One, but it\u2019s promising for The Smashing Machine This is insane. It really is; however, after watching the\u00a0[*Red One*\u00a0trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l3hfD74X-4)\u00a0and seeing the first image from\u00a0[*The Smashing Machine*](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cx7e6g/first_image_of_dwayne_johnson_in_benny_safdies/)*,*\u00a0I became convinced that there was a correlation between the sweatiness of a Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson performance and its impact (good or bad) on his career. Between T*he Rundown, Fast Five, Pain & Gain*, and\u00a0*The Game Plan*, his career heats up when his body is trying to cool down. This is why I\u2019m optimistic about\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, as it seems like Johnson is going back to basics to escape his recent VFX-heavy run.\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0will be a sweaty reset \u2013 which is what Johnson has relied on for 20+ years of success.\u00a0\n\nJohnson has made a career out of talking/posting/writing about his sweat. The tagline for his Under Armour collaboration is \u201c[BLOOD, SWEAT, RESPECT](https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2018/11/blood--sweat--respect.html),\u201d and when\u00a0[talking about his career,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-rock-inside-dwayne-johnsons-turbulent-delinquent-pre-fame/)\u00a0he said, \u201cYou gotta get up in the morning, you gotta get after it, you gotta put in the work, you gotta sweat. There\u2019s gonna be heavy iron, and there\u2019s gonna be a lot of sweat, and it\u2019s gonna be dirty.\u201d His Instagram posts almost always make sure to include the word \u201c[Sweat](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Qr-GNyoYk/?img_index=therock).\u201d. He\u2019s basically worked sweat into his persona ([Sweat Equity\u00a0](https://www.instagram.com/therock/p/CQpiWpdFyRq/?hl=en)is his thing), so this data isn\u2019t as random or dumb as you\u2019d think.\n\nThe sweat levels should only go to 10, but after watching his movies again, I had to create an \u201c11\u201d category because there are a handful of movies in which Johnson\u2019s sweat glands work overtime. To place each film in their respective categories, I rewatched his movies, looked for sweaty scenes/moments (Yes \u2013 it\u2019s wild, but I had to follow the idea), and came up with a chart. It wasn\u2019t too hard because, since 2017, I\u2019ve been assigned a\u00a0[handful of Dwayne Johnson data posts\u00a0](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/dwayne-johnsons-12-trillion-movie-damage-bill/)and research assignments, so they\u2019ve familiarized me with his filmography. Also, if you're want to learn more about the data collection I recorded a podcast episode about it (Movies, Films and Flix pod - you can find it anywhere).\n\n* **Category 11 \u2013 Red**\u00a0\u2013 The distribution makes me happy\n* **Category 9 \u2013 10 \u2013 Purple**\u00a0\u2013 on average, it\u2019s the most lucrative category\n* **Category 5 \u2013 8 \u2013 Green**\u00a0\u2013 Hasn\u2019t made a category 5-8 movie since 2017\u2019s\u00a0**The Fate of the Furious**.\u00a0\n* **Category 0 \u2013 4 \u2013 Orange**\u00a0\u2013 6 of his last 10 movies fall in this category.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pshv2wn5sv0e1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b210c750904264b8e3d997d8f364e0ac701180\n\nSix films fall into the 11 category:\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain & Gain, Skyscraper*, and\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0(it\u2019s hypothetical). In their own way, these movies have proven important in The Rock\u2019s\u00a0 evolution as an actor and act as cornerstones of his filmography that have influenced his career.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown. I included longer explanations of their importance below, but these work as nice cliff notes if you are in a hurry or hate reading.\u00a0\n\n* **The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 In an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that when\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0was met with praise from critics, action fans, and general audiences, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\u00a0\n* **The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013 After\u00a0*Walking Tall, Doom, Gridiron Gang,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Be Cool,*\u00a0Johnson needed a hit, which came in the form of the PG-Rated Disney film\u00a0*The Game Plan*. Not only did it help him build a new fanbase, but it was his first non-action film to make more than $100 million worldwide.\u00a0\n* **Fast Five (2011)**\u2013 Once again, after\u00a0*Southland Tales, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Faster*, Johnson found new management and reset his career path. He shaved his head, gained 30 pounds, and got mean again for\u00a0*Fast Five.*\u00a0This propelled him into the action stratosphere.\n* **Pain & Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013 Not only does it feature his best performance, but it\u2019s also his best R-rated film, and he will probably never play a character like this again. In 2013, both\u00a0*Pain & Gain*\u00a0and\u00a0*Snitch*\u00a0failed to clear $100 million at the worldwide box office \u2013 that hasn\u2019t happened since.\u00a0\n* **Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013 The movie underwhelmed at the box office and kicked off a new era of \u201cimmortal Superman\u201d Johnson. It\u2019s wild watching this film now and seeing a Dwayne Johnson character crying while cradling his daughter atop a burning skyscraper (don\u2019t worry, Neve Campbell saves the day).\u00a0\n\n**Here are longer explanations of why these films are important (if you read the above section, you can skip to the numbers below)**\n\n**1. The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson\u2019s first starring role in\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0was a success, and it did well theatrically. Still, Johnson wanted other roles to prove he could carry a dialogue-heavy action film that wasn\u2019t part of an existing franchise. Johnson took\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0role to step up his acting game and credits director Peter Berg as his \u201cpersonal acting coach on set every day.\u201d After watching the film,\u00a0[Ebert gave it 3.5 stars](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u00a0and dropped this doozy of a compliment\n\n* [Ebert\u00a0](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u2013 \u201cEarly in \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d The Rock enters a nightclub to confront some tough guys, and he passes Arnold Schwarzenegger on the way out. \u2018Have a good time,\u2019 Arnold says. It\u2019s like he\u2019s passing the torch. Whether The Rock will rival Schwarzenegger\u2019s long run as an action hero is hard to say \u2014 but on the basis of \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d he has a good chance.\u201d\n\n* I like this David Shoemaker paragraph from his\u00a0[Grantland](https://grantland.com/features/a-look-career-dwayne-rock-johnson-eve-wrestlemania-29-new-film-pain-gain/)\u00a0days \u2013 \u201cFor the first time, Johnson feels like a legitimate star, but that\u2019s mostly thanks to director Peter Berg, who understood that Johnson\u2019s true talent was his humor. Rather than portray Johnson as a muscly automaton in some hard-boiled revenge tale, Berg made a grimy comedy and allowed Johnson to have fun. Even the fight scenes (of which there are many) are played for chuckles.\u201d\n\nJohnson went all out ([he lost 20 pounds for the role to be more lean](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/)), and the positive reviews proved that he could headline a reasonably successful action film. It was a big step in his acting career, and in an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that after acting in\u00a0*The Rundown*, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u2014He carried a critically appreciated action film and proved he could act alongside people like Christopher Walken. It was his first critically adored film and his only Fresh (60% or higher Tomatometer score) film for eight years (2003 \u2013 2011). It\u2019s still his highest-rated \u201cDwayne Johnson\u201d film (*Hobbs and Shaw,*\u00a0he\u2019s a co-lead, and he\u2019s part of an ensemble in\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0and the\u00a0*Jumanji*\u00a0films).\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment(s)**\u00a0\u2013 His character does wipe out an entire army, but it\u2019s nice when he looks fallible. There are some good scenes\u00a0[when he has his butt kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXF9gcUcNU&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&index=7&pp=iAQB),\u00a0[gets harassed by baboons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdYPqVZIB9M&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&index=6&pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[rolls down hills](https://youtu.be/jKyhNbLEKxY?list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut).\u00a0\n\n**2. The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*The Game Plan*\u00a0was Johnson\u2019s first $100 million grossing film since\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0(2002), proving he could headline family-friendly comedies. Johnson said he wanted to make a\u00a0[movie that his daughter could watch,](https://www.blackfilm.com/20070921/features/dwaynejohnson.shtml)\u00a0but it was mainly a smart pivot after\u00a0*Doom, Be Cool*, and\u00a0*Walking Tall*\u00a0didn\u2019t take off. It definitely boosted his box office marketability, and he went on to appear in\u00a0*Get Smart, Tooth Fairy, Race to Witch Mountain*, and\u00a0*The Other Guys*\u00a0(which all grossed over $100 million).\u00a0\n\n**Importance of Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson picked up a new fan base, and the role helped re-spark his career for a short time.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013 He\u00a0[cries](https://youtu.be/ZD8wDJKzEgY),\u00a0[dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFwBMwCOF-Q&pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQuA6Iobmqw&pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sweats](https://youtu.be/XGQRDirweUM),\u00a0[reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI17vaYpW1A&list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&index=9&pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[sings more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfKjInbMjnw&list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&index=20&pp=iAQB). You can legitimately feel the desperation and willingness to do anything to make the movie work.\n\n**3. Fast Five (2011) \u2013**\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0currently has his highest IMDb and Letterboxd scores of any Johnson film, and it legitimately propelled him into the big leagues. On the set of\u00a0*Fast Five*, he told his makeup artist to\u00a0[leave him alone and let him be sweaty](https://x.com/TheRock/status/1336855153719185408)\u2014this paid off.\u00a0\n\n[In an interview with Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a36037/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-0815/), Johnson said he had a moment of clarity in 2010 when he realized he had to \u201cstop, readjust, reassess, and change everything around me\u2014and I gotta take one more shot.\u201d He needed to take one more shot at superstardom after years of movies like\u00a0*Faster, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy*, and\u00a0*Planet 51*\u00a0(*Southland Tales*\u00a0didn\u2019t help either), lowered his stock, and halted any growth as an actor. So, he changed up his management, and after years of talking to Vin Diesel about joining the\u00a0*Fast and Furious*\u00a0franchise, he shaved his head, grew an insane goatee, and put on\u00a0[30 pounds of weight](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/#:~:text='Fast%20Five'%20(2011),-Johnson's%20turn%20as&text=of%20crime%20fighter.-,After%20years%20of%20leaner%20roles%20in%20films%20like%20Tooth%20Fairy,doughy%2Dby%2Dcomparison%20Diesel.)\u00a0(after years of being encouraged to lose weight) to play Luke Hobbs in\u00a0*Fast Five*. The film was a gigantic hit, propelling Johnson into the action stratosphere. It\u2019s worth noting that this is easily his sweatiest film \u2013 and probably his best action movie.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 He got mean again and kicked some ass.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[He loses a fight to Vin Diesel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2PsfXZ3wyY&pp=ygUPZmFzdCBmaXZlIGZpZ2h0). This won\u2019t happen again.\u00a0\n\n**4. Pain & Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Pain & Gain*\u00a0features Johnson\u2019s best performance (he\u2019s perfect in it), and it was nice seeing him back in R-rated territory after\u00a0*Faster, Southland Tales*, and\u00a0*Doom*\u00a0didn\u2019t click with the mainstream. Johnson accepted a massive pay cut (the main actors all did this for a cut of the backend) because he loved the complexity of the role, and it was a nice departure from his typical type of role. The film didn\u2019t make much money, but it\u2019s a beautifully sweaty (and nasty) piece of Michael Bay R-rated Bayhem. What\u2019s interesting is that since\u00a0*Pain & Gain*, he\u2019s veered away from performances like this and, in 2018, said, \u201c[No one\u2019s going to see me play a borderline psychopath suffering from depression](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/dwayne-johnson-the-pain-and-the-passion-that-fuel-the-rock-630076/).\u201d This is kind of a bummer because he\u2019s given up on edgy performances that push him as an actor and instead dove into more safe comedies and action films.\u00a0\n\n**Quick Note**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[During a 2024 GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0he backtracked on his 2018 comments and said \u201cI don\u2019t know who the f\\*\\*k that guy is.\u201d\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 It proved he still had an edge and could push himself in non-blockbusters. Also, as Johnson said, \u201c[The biggest departure](https://theultimaterabbit.com/2019/06/09/dwayne-johnson-on-getting-pumped-up-for-pain-gain/)\u00a0(for me) was the vulnerability, showing this type of vulnerability and playing a character who is easily influenced and who\u2019s just out of prison and looking for salvation.\u201d\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The neighborhood watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diiaCw3frzo&pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz)\u00a0scene is wonderful.\u00a0[He\u2019s terrible at robbing banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8lQy1CTlZk&pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz), and\u00a0[I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll never see him grill a hand again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esg4w4b2xvc&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqr50cPGNoGN1w-TAWqYwpMr&index=10&pp=iAQB).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s easily his best R-rated film.\u00a0\n\n**5. Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0didn\u2019t make globs of money or achieve critical praise, BUT it features a different type of Johnson performance. SPOILER \u2013 At the end of the film, he\u2019s sitting atop a skyscraper and awaiting his death while he clings to his daughter (he\u2019s also crying, which is rare). At the last second, Neve Campbell saves the day and resets the skyscraper\u2019s fire extinguishers. The movie received a lot of pre-buzz because Johnson\u2019s character lost a leg and had to save the day with a prosthesis. It\u2019s an odd choice (I guess it takes away from his superhuman prowess), but he went on an all-out promotional campaign and seemed to genuinely care about normalizing disabilities.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, this is probably the last time we\u2019ll see this kind of character from Johnson. He tried to play a \u201cnormal guy,\u201d and it didn\u2019t work. He followed it up with\u00a0*Hobbs and Shaw*\u00a0(Hobbs becomes a superhero in it),\u00a0*Jumanji: The Next Level*\u00a0(plays a dude named Smolder Bravestone),\u00a0*Jungle Cruise*\u00a0(no spoilers \u2013 you\u2019ll see),\u00a0*Red Notice*\u00a0(barf) and\u00a0*Black Adam*\u00a0(wildly powerful). They are miles away from his\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0character and more in line with his over-the-top persona. So, even though\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a hit, his decisions were somewhat altered because of its lack of success.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 His plan didn\u2019t work, and he slowed his film output. He played a major role in seven films between 2016 and 2018, and has appeared in six films in the last five years.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The finale of the film sees him cradling his daughter while they wait to be burnt alive (he\u2019s also crying)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M06KzvYxlsc&pp=ygURc2t5c2NyYXBlciBlbmRpbmc%3D). He REALLY wanted to seem fallible.\u00a0\n\n**Why do I think The Smashing Machine will be a sweaty success?**\n\n[Here\u2019s a quote from a recent GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0\u2013 \u201cIt was also an opportunity for me, I realized, to stretch myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been stretched yet, and also challenge myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been challenged.\u201d\n\nBetween\u00a0*Red Notice, Black Adam, Jungle Cruise,*\u00a0and the upcoming\u00a0*Red One,*\u00a0Johnson has taken a lot of flak for reportedly being the alleged reason for the swelling budgets and less-than-stellar critical and box office results (there are other reasons, of course\u2026). His\u00a0*Fast X*\u00a0appearance didn\u2019t light the world on fire either. So, when it was announced that he was going to star in the Benny Safdie-directed\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, a film adaptation named after the excellent 2002 documentary about MMA fighter Mark Kerr ([watch the doc \u2013 it\u2019s awesome](https://youtu.be/-7DO5c7gWNw)) \u2013 I knew it was Johnson pulling a hard reset on his VFX heavy blockbuster run. When I saw the sweaty first image, it became obvious that Johnson was up to his old tricks he\u2019s used throughout his career (hard resets and sweaty pivots). What\u2019s funny is that Safdie and Johnson had talked about making the film since 2019, when Johnson bought the rights to Kerr\u2019s story. Johnson admittedly\u00a0[ghosted Safdie for several years](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-mark-kerr-movie-1234940165/)\u00a0(\u201cBenny thought I ghosted him, and maybe I was just a f\\*\\*\\*in\u2019 asshole\u201d), but after years of not-so-great movies and a chat with Emily Blunt, Johnson called Safdie back, and now they\u2019ve made the movie. Johnson says he hasn\u2019t quit \u201cfour-quadrant blockbusters,\u201d but he needed a career reset to explore films with more humanity. It\u2019s a smart move \u2013 and it all points back to sweaty performances.\u00a0\n\n**The Numbers**\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is that his incredibly sweaty films have a slightly higher critical/user average than his less-sweaty movies. The differences aren\u2019t anything big, but they prove that a little extra sweat helps.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**11 \u2013 Wild Amounts of Sweat**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 55.2\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.9\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.5\n* Box Office Average\u00a0 \u2013 $249 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain & Gain, Skyscraper*\n* *Fast Five*\u00a0has the highest IMDb score (7.3) and Letterboxd score (3.4)\n* *The Game Plan*\u00a0was his first non-action film to clear $100 million worldwide\n* *The Rundown*\u00a0was his first film with a Fresh Tomatometer Score\n\nThe biggest drawback to sweat-heavy movies is that they aren\u2019t huge earners. However, when done right, they lead to bigger box office results. This is why Johnson is taking the role in the A24-produced\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*.\u00a0\n\n**9-10 \u2013 Sweat City**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 54%\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.58\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.2\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $613 million (Aside from\u00a0*Doom*, these movies make money.\u00a0)\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Furious 7, Doom, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw, Rampage,*\n* *Furious 7*\u00a0is his highest-grossing film and most critically lauded\n* *Hobbs and Shaw*\u00a0is his highest-grossing film, with only one co-lead (Statham)\n* *Rampage*\u00a0is the fourth highest-grossing video game adaptation\n\n\n\n**5-8 \u2013 Gonna Need a New Shirt**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 40.9%\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.48\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $268 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Hercules, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Walking Tall, The Scorpion King, Tooth Fairy, GI Joe Retaliation, The Fate of the Furious, The Gridiron Gang, Race to Witch Mountain, Faster*\n* *Note \u2013*\u00a0None of these films feature an overly excessive amount of sweat.\u00a0\n* Only one of these films scores 60% or more on Rotten Tomatoes.\n* He hasn\u2019t made a 5-8 category movie since 2017\u2019s\u00a0*The Fate of the Furious*.\u00a0\n\n**0 \u2013 4 \u2013 Zero to Light Sweaters**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 53.2\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.72\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.28\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $356 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Southland Tales, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Jumanji: The Next Level, Jungle Cruise, San Andreas, The Mummy Returns, Baywatch, Fast & Furious 6, Snitch, Get Smart, Central Intelligence, Be Cool, The Other Guys, Empire State, Black Adam, Red Notice*\n* *Red Notice, Black Adam, and Red One*\u00a0fall in this category, and they have a 38% Tomatometer average.

Dabei legt er sich auch mit gro\u00dfen Konzernen wie BMW und Netflix an. ", "Company Travel - always a rich vein for this sub! Reading some of the submissions here of late reminded me of a company I worked for around 10 years ago.\n\nI was an IT Tech, this company had factories in 3 corners of the UK (Southampton, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and Belfast) as well as more factories and offices around the globe.\n\nBeing the IT base in Southampton, we'd quite regularly have to fly up to Newcastle, or over to Belfast to fix an issue or just for routine maintenance on their kit. Often the higher-up managers would be making the same journeys, so we'd arrange with their PA to share the taxi from the office to the airport, make sure we're on the same flight, then share the taxi at the other end to the factory there.\n\nThese were \"Executive\" taxis - long wheelbase BMW 7 Series and Merc S class usually. At the destination there'd be a man with a little sign for the Exec who grab his/her bags and take us to the car. All very nice.\n\nIf the visit required an overnight stay, they'd put us up in the same 4-star hotel as the Execs as it was near the factory (on an industrial estate), and again, we could share taxis.\n\nThis was a pretty sweet, and sensible deal. Until.\n\nThe company was owned by a larger group, who decided on a top-down edict that all job grades below Exec level didn't get business class travel. Didn't get exec taxis. No 4 star hotels. We could also ONLY eat at the hotel's restaurant, unless we were \"entertaining\" guests from another company.\n\nObviously this was going to affect us as an IT team, so we tried to push back on it. Not happening. You have to follow the letter of the law. The PAs (we had one for IT as well as the couple who worked for the Execs) got their heads together and came up with the plan.\n\nFirst thing was, our flights had to change. We were previously using an airline which operated small aircraft in a \"Business-class only\" configuration. They left Southampton at around 8am, meaning we'd arrive in Newcastle ready to start the day's work. The return flight departed at 18:30 ish, meaning we could leave at 5 and get home in time for dinner.\n\nThe only other option was a commercial airline. This flight left mid-morning, and because it wasn't business-class, it took longer to get through security etc, meaning we had to present at the airport at 9ish for the 11:15 flight. Not arriving in Newcastle until lunchtime. Wasted half a day working right there. \n\nRather than sharing the Executive taxi to the airport - with which we had an account - we were stand on the street and hail a Hackney - which turned out to cost nearly twice the pre-booked \"Exec\" option.\n\nThe return flight departed at 15:30, so unless you only had an hour's work to do, you had to now stay the night somewhere. We were only allowed to book from one of two chains - Premier Inn and Travelodge.  \nTurns out the Premier Inn in the middle of Newcastle costs more than the 4 star place out on the Industrial Estate. Plus now I've got places to go out - and a much longer taxi ride from the office.\n\nAs anyone who's stayed in one knows, these chain hotels have generally crap but hugely overpriced restaurants. I can see cheap options which I'd be fine with like Nando's or Zizzi from my room, but no, I have to go to the onsite restaurant and order a \u00a325 steak.\n\nMy favourite trip was one where I had to take a new server up there - the company wouldn't pay for it to be couriered as it was too heavy. They wouldn't pay for the baggage allowance - policy was only cabin baggage on the commercial flights - they would have taken it no probs on the other airline.\n\nSo I had to drive. Company standard was to pay 45p a mile for the first 10,000 business miles in a tax year. I'd recently bought a cheap diesel that would do 70+mpg if I kept it below 60mph. And as I'd be driving on company time, why not? 350 miles each way cost me a little over \u00a350 on diesel at that time, and I got paid \u00a3315 in expenses for doing it. The air fare on the business class jet would have been around \u00a3250 return.\n\nOur departmental PA worked out that travel as a whole was now costing the IT dept roughly 3 times what it used to under the old system, and that's not counting the missed hours when we could have been working. Of course nothing ever came of it, because the people who make these decisions never bother looking into the impact of them, or probably never even get a report that would highlight it. From our point of view it meant a problem that could be sorted in a single day now took at least two, and we were away from the office a lot more.", "What blocking disabled parking spots means Here's a story I was told about the effect of blocking disabled spots. This is a long post by necessity - I apologise in advance (for the length and any formatting errors) but it has to be long to reflect the impact that \" sure it's only 2 minutes\" can have on disabled people and the people who care for them. I've spent a significant amount of my professional life working with disabled people and this is a story a single parent (lets call her Jenny) of two children with disabilities told at a training event I attended early in my career which has always stayed with me. Some details have been changed to protect hers and her children's identity.\n\nJenny lives rurally. Jenny has two children (lets call them Aidan and Claire) with physical disabilities, they're both wheelchair users. Aidan is her older child and also has a profound intellectual disability. This is what a trip to the shops looks like for Jenny's family. She does all the same things to get ready to go to the shops that you do. She gets dressed, grabs her handbag, her phone etc. She does this while Aidan & Claire are still asleep. Then Jenny wakes Aidan. She raises the height of his adjustable bed, rolls him to one side to remove his nightclothes and change him. Then Jenny rolls him side to side again to dress him, and then another rolling manoeuvre to place a sling under him. Jenny moves in a hoist (example of what a hoist and sling look like [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0477/3681/5775/products/patient_aid-29_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1604569227)), then she moves in Aidan's wheelchair and uses the hoist to transfer him out into his chair where she puts on his splints and shoes. Then she brings him to the living room which is awkward and difficult because of the size and layout of her house and the size of the chair. There she puts on Peppa Pig to keep him entertained. Then she does all this again with Claire but Claire is younger, lighter and more mobile and is able to do a bit more for herself. But Jenny is frequently obliged to leave Claire to check on Aidan who gets distressed easily.\n\nJenny then hopes it isn't raining, goes out to the car and lowers its wheelchair ramp. Then she puts out a foldable ramp on the front step and manoeuvres Aidan in his large and heavy power chair down this ramp and then onto and up the car ramp where she secures it in place using built in hooks and straps before raising the car ramp back up again. Aidan is extremely distressed by this entire process and often hits and scratches Jenny. She then puts on Peppa Pig music to try and keep him calm and goes to get Claire. This time she is bringing a lighter wheelchair down the ramp and instead lifts Claire from her wheelchair into the car. It is not an easy lift, she is risking injury to them both by doing it and she definitely cannot do it forever because Claire is getting bigger and heavier as she gets older but this is the car they have right now. She then removes the wheels and footplates from Claire's wheelchair, collapses it down and stows it in the car. From the point when both children are dressed it takes Jenny about 45 minutes to get them both into the car.\n\nNow they get where they were planning to go (e.g. their nearest supermarket is a 30 minute drive). When they are out and about Claire moves around in her wheelchair independently and Jenny moves Aidan in his power chair. But there's no disabled parking when they get to their destination, there are only two disabled spots and a BMW has parked across them both. Jenny can't park in a non-disabled spot because she can't lift Claire out without the door being open fully. She can't put Claire in her wheelchair because she can't fit the wheelchair up alongside the car and she isn't able to carry Claire any further than the brief lift from car to chair. Jenny can't just take Aidan out because she can't get the ramp down at the back of the car because the parking spot isn't deep enough and she'd have to do a 10-15 minute procedure while blocking traffic around her while Aidan is in distress. And then Claire would be left in the car alone anyway. She can't park far away in a spot with no cars around it because she can't guarantee someone won't park next to them while they're inside. Plus it's hard for Claire to get her wheelchair across a car park with lumps and bumps and drains and slopes.\n\nJenny can't leave the children unattended to go find the BMW driver because Aidan could become very distressed and is sitting right next to Claire who he may injure if left alone unsupervised, even if she was prepared for potential conflict with the owner of the BMW. She can't wait for the driver to come back because Aidan is getting increasingly distressed and she has no way of knowing if they will be in there for two minutes or two hours. So instead of going to the pharmacy or getting groceries Jenny turns around, drives 30 minutes back home and repeats the leaving the house process in reverse and that's 2.5 hours of their day gone for nothing, on top of all the physical labour Jenny puts into the process and the distress it causes her children. Aidan is exhausted and agitated, Claire is frustrated, humiliated and disappointed. Jenny is tired and angry and sad for her children.\n\ntl:dr - Your 2 minute nip into the shop can have an incredible impact on a disabled person - please do not block disable spots. My answer to every justification and rationalisation and \"what if\" or \"why doesn't she\" reply you're thinking of posting to this is \"Stop being a selfish cunt and just walk the extra 15m, you need the exercise anyway.\"", "Tl;dr I lent my car to a friend, he refuses to give it back, and the police say they can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s a civil matter. Tl;dr I lent my car to a friend, he refuses to give it back, and the police say they can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s a civil matter.\n\nIn February of this year, I made the decision to purchase a BMW M4, influenced by a close friend who assured me that he would eventually buy it from me. We agreed to co-own the vehicle, but since my friend couldn't contribute financially at the time, I covered the entire cost myself. The plan was for us to enjoy the car together, and I trusted that he would either pay half the car's price or purchase it from me later.\n\nI left the car with my friend in Minnesota, trusting him to handle its maintenance if he were to use the vehicle. However, he appears to have made modifications without my knowledge, claiming he was fixing the car, though he never specified what repairs were needed.\u00a0\n\nInitially, we planned to register the car in Massachusetts under my name since I held the title. But my friend objected, preferring not to have Massachusetts plates, believing it would negatively impact his social life, in particular with attracting the females. Instead, he proposed registering the car under an LLC in Montana, which he initiated, but the process was too slow.\n\nBy early May, I pressed my friend to return the car so I could register it in Massachusetts, as delaying the registration was incurring late fees. My friend became increasingly agitated and aggressive. He then informed me the car was not operational due to engine flooding, suggesting we had been scammed by the dealership. I suspected he had tampered with the engine without my knowledge.\n\nDespite my efforts to resolve the issue, my friend insisted I sell the car in Minnesota and demanded I pay him $7,000 for alleged repairs. When I asked for the car back, he and his father refused, claiming they had already provided receipts for the repairs, which they had not. My repeated requests for these receipts were met with threats from his father, who warned of potential damage to my career and citizenship and coerced me into considering a sale at a significant loss, while also threatening to increase their demand to $15,000.\n\nThe friend paid \\~2k towards the downpayment of purchasing the car. The friend then paid $900 towards shipping the car to MN from Seattle, WA. The friend then alleges another 3k in repairs (I have been asking them receipts for this, but the father and son keep telling me that the receipts were sent to me). The father then sent me screenshots of the work. The father and son are working very closely to scam me.\n\nFather also proposes to liquidate the car. Father and son propose to sell the car, then give me my share and they take theirs. Son says he had an offer of 14k for the car so far. They will take their 7k, leaving me with 7k. Father gave a number of 20k.\n\nIn total, I have invested around $50,000 in this car, driven by good faith and the expectation of shared experiences with a friend who now shows no mercy.\n\nI have filed a police complaint in MN to get my vehicle back, however the father and child had already informed the cops about their version of the story. The police informed me that this is a civil matter and that they are unable to resolve it.\n\nFather and son then send me receipts that seem like they have been forged.\u00a0\n\nThe vehicle is currently with them and I\u2019m not sure how to proceed from here. Please help me.\n\nI want my car back in working condition, as I have left it, or I want my money back. I don't want to deal with the hassle of going to court. People have told me that this is a very long and painful and expensive process. I have no time or energy for this at the moment.\n\nSon has previously warned me that his family is wealthy and that they can destroy me.

ESG ratings provided by ratings agencies help determine whether a mutual fund or ETF does well by ratings of metrics including environmental concerns, slavery use in supply chain issues, animal cruelty and more. ESG ratings have grown more popular and have been performing well in recent markets.**\n* **However, ESG scores have been horribly inconsistent across different companies. Most notably, Tesla was at one point ranked an #1 and dead last across different agencies. Currently, Musk has criticized S&P for removing Tesla from a sustainability index but keeping oil giant Exxon Mobil. Even ESG scores among ratings agencies in the same company (Morgan Stanley's MSCI in one study) do not correlate often with one another's ESG ratings.**\n* **ESG ratings might be seen as a proxy for risk, so good ESG score is seen as good risk management. This might not be true, as not only are ratings often inconsistent, many companies hide their methodology from researchers, but many banks and firms (Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon) have been investigated over ESG ratings issues or outright fraud. Most notably, Deutsche had its ESG arm for DWS raided by 50 men in Frankfurt in recent weeks.**\n* **Many current and future issues exist for ESG ratings, such as the fact that short positions do not need to be reported in ESG ratings for hedge funds and there are worries of \"double counting\" emissions during securities lending. ESG ratings--and their wide range of potential risk--have also come under pressure to a growing number of derivates that exist, including \"green\" collateralized debt obligations and \"blue bonds\" or \"ocean-related sovereign ESG debt swaps\". 2 researchers for the Bank of International Settlements compared the risk of ESG ratings/products as parallel to the rise of MBS products pre-2008.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icfm8ax8g7791.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=40637c48ca298b869331b96a24c99cfbfed21ec9\n\n**Sections**  \n**1.

What is ESG?\n\nESG = Environmental Social Governance.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Unless your Lindsay apparently](https://preview.redd.it/0gkx4glkh7791.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1f1540b2aada85c8c76047026f035e77a1c2f2)\n\nESG, despite its weird abbreviation, has been growing in popularity for some time. In fact, as of 2020, one report said 1/3rd of all capital under management in the US was managed by ESG funds.\n\n**Growing demand means increased interest in ESG rankings has led to increased pulls for ESG data. For example, the US Dept. of Labor pushed a new rule in 2020 keeps ERISA plans from selecting unrelated ESG stocks not related to plan participants. And in Europe, even though some form of ESG investing/ranking has been around for 2 decades, it\u2019s only ramped up more now especially in the wake of the EU Commission\u2019s new sustainable finance strategy that got launched in 2021.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESG investing CAN have material effects on stocks: long-term risk management adjustment. These, ahem \u201csustainability-related financial products\u201d seem to give people more than just a feel-good post-masturbatory sense of calm. Here\u2019s one such plus: a 2020 study found that ESG products that perform as well, if not better than traditional market-weighted investments. What\u2019s not to love!\n\n**The real-term impact of ESG metrics is not to be undervalued. This includes everything from making sure the chocolate that your young\u2019ns nibble on wasn\u2019t harvested by the hands of slave laborers in West Africa (cough cough Nestle), or that your construction doesn\u2019t fuck the water supply in the Midwest. ESG companies with strong scores mean that they might be doing right by the climate, or that they might even be avoiding animal abuse in terms of how their products are made or sourced.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it is to be believed that not only are you doing good with your money, but also making returns, this is why many look to the bigs in the ESG ratings world, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Morgan Stanley\u2019s (ahem) MSCI Research, Thomson Reuters & Sustainalytics, etc. to help them navigate the waters of happiness, sunshine, and eco-friendly tendies for all.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n# 2. How It Goes Wrong\n\n\u200b\n\n**In short, ESG is a feelgood sticker slapped on your mutual fund or ETF.**\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ed3rimyh7791.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca22b56b7695df87a1bf86ca204b775f70f704c\n\nESG investing\u2013sometimes called sUsTaInAbLe fInAnCe\u2013is so self-masturbatory you might as well bring out the jumper cables and nipple balm. Institutional investors and mutual funds have taken notice more and more of how iffy these scores end up being. The OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) found frameworks vary A LOT between different ratings agencies. And I mean A LOT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ESG ratings methodology remains inconsistent among providers, with less than robust data to back up any claims; in fact, back in 2017 a BNP Paribas study said 55% of institutional funds said there was SO LITTLE DATA on how the ESG scores were even made up that that\u2019s what kept them from jumping into more ESG investments.**\n\n**Because surprise surprise, a lot of ESG\u2013like literally fucking everything in the stock market\u2013relies on self-reported data.** (We examined ourselves and found nothing wrong.)\n\n# 3. ESG Scoring\n\nESG scores can rank on everything from carbon score to gender diversity. But like most credit agency work, ESG scoring is a black box and some even wonder if they are even necessary being so hidden. **At their heart, ESG scores are like any rating system: arbitrary.** GreenBiz\u2019s Joel Makower threw the literary version of a bedpost at ESG scoring when he said this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**\u201cESG ratings are first and foremost an independent opinion about the environmental, social and governance risks facing a company and its shareholders, not the risks to people and the planet.\u201d**\n\nSometimes, the issue of ESG ratings differences come down due to its methodology (\u201ccommensurability problem\u201d) or defining what an ESG construct is (\u201ctheorisation problem\u201d). Agencies are NOT transparent, remaining opaque about many of these ESG rankings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is also important since this is helpful for data research for academics and hurts actual research that can even be done to see whether 3rd-party sources can confirm how accurate ESG scoring is, what it means for the environment, animal rights, etc.**  \n\n\n[this is prob way more transparent than any ESG agency rn](https://preview.redd.it/j3y3bpwei7791.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ba3d331f54996295794303212b29b3a45c875a)\n\nBut at it\u2019s heart and per Makower, these ratings really often don\u2019t give a shit about people and the planet. Often, there is confusion between ESG and another old-school metric: impact investing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cIn principle, the concept of an ESG rating might seem simple: A ratings provider generates a rating, say on a scale from AAA to D, of how well a business incorporates ESG practices and considerations.\u00a0  \n>  \n>The reality is more complicated. There is no agreement on what to measure, how to measure it or for what purpose. Most fundamentally, there has been pervasive confusion between ESG and impact investing. **This can result in the false impression that ESG ratings measure a company\u2019s impact on the environment or social wellbeing.**\u00a0  \n>  \n>**This is typically not the case. Most ESG ratings measure the risks and opportunities to the rated company of ESG-related factors, not the impact the company has on the environment or society.\u201d**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Scandal\n\nSo it\u2019s the company itself is who benefits or is hurt by these ratings. Not the earth, not its people like you and me, not its animals, etc. etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[nothing says green like installing \\\\\"emissions cheating devices\\\\\" in your cars](https://preview.redd.it/3rckynvpi7791.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=c581a672e450990b7b231e9ed755ad423a7071c9)\n\nRemember, ESG matters when you consider corporate scandals in the mix. Although we all know Volkswagen for the VW squeeze back in 2008, there was a huge uproar over falsified data on green reports. **Wells Fargo was also recently in the news for lying about how many minorities even show up on their goddamn interviews.**\u00a0\n\nAnother famous example includes fast fashion company Boohoo. Boohoo was an ESG ratings darling for some time by many agencies, receiving nonstop outstanding ratings\u2026only to be caught in a major forced laubour scandal (i.e. slavery) which made many question those ratings. (Quelle surprise!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You start to see then really quickly why these ratings might matter if for example, you buy into Volkswagen hoping their as green as they say they are only to find out they\u2019ve been fraudulently lying about their pollution metrics the entire goddamn time.**\n\n# 5. One Bank\u2019s Trash is Another Bank\u2019s Treasure\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat makes it worse is that the wide range of scoring only shows just how arbitrary the process is, perhaps only proving furthermore how much its more for the companies than the world. Two researchers found after poring through the 70 ratings providers, they honed in on examining 2 ESG ratings providers. From those 2, they found that there was \u201clarge performance dispersion and low correlation of returns\u201d on 2 pairs of ESG portfolios and individual picks were even MORE out of wack.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvw7cr6tg7791.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce0bdced123c1af510fe8a10f3526bbf361e50a\n\nSo it\u2019s seen that despite what should soon like a great thing, ESG ranking are literally ALL OVER THE FUCKING MAP.\u00a0\n\nI**n 2018, FTSE said Teslas was dead last in ESG performance but Morgan Stanley\u2019s MSCI\u2013the current larger provider of ESG ratings\u2013 said it was #1, with Sustainanalytics putting it in the middle. For another car you get the same idea: \u201cUnlike credit ratings, ESG ratings can be wildly inconsistent between different providers. For example, MSCI gives one vehicle manufacturer a very low rating of CCC, whereas Standard & Poor\u2019s gives it a score of 61, roughly equal to an MSCI rating of A.\u201d**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[regardless of your view of Musk, his criticism of S&P is spot on](https://preview.redd.it/als2osg0j7791.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=43ed03841009ed11c2567c6147034b21ceb6617d)\n\n**If you want even more Tesla tomfuckery, hell just THIS MONTH, S&P Global removed Tesla from its ESG 500 index..but fucking kept oil giant EXXON MOBIL who has been in the news for multiple scandals. Just last year, Exxon was even suspended from the Climate Leadership Council after an Exxon lobbyist was caught on camera openly saying they were only for faking saying they were for a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d because they actually knew it would never pass or be implemented.**\u00a0\n\nThe (dis)similarities don\u2019t stop there. In fact, for 2 of the biggest rankers\u2013Reuters\u2019 ASSET 4 and MSCI\u2013their ratings don\u2019t even seem to converge to other rankings like AT ALL. After a statistical study, they connect anywhere between 0.05 (!) to 0.39 in terms of their correlation coefficients after academic research studies. Which puts their likelihood to be in the same ballpark as other ranking systems as less than 40%...AT BEST.\n\n# 6. Me vs. the ESG Company in the Mirror\n\nSo you might say \u201cOk, but that\u2019s Reuters vs. Morgan Stanley. These are 2 different companies, so that\u2019s different!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Great point! But just to show how much of a shitshow it is, researchers at Schroeder\u2019s compared ESG scoring WITHIN the same company (Morgan Stanley/MSCI) and showed EVEN THEN it didn\u2019t fucking line up.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awej2hlng7791.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=31eaf2c9cb2fb33d93b594c608374ca96b174274\n\n**Last year, Schroeder\u2019s mentioned that the 6 Morgan Stanley\u2019s MSCI indices tracking ESG scores, BARELY correlated WITH EACH OTHER even inside the same parent company over 5 years.** Only 2 of the funds correlated in a pairing greater than 0.5 (0.6, or 60%), just barely better than randomly flipping a coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 7. You Need More People\n\nAs you quickly see, this leads to some confusing shit. For example, as of early 2021, Reuters\u2019 ESG rankings is the ONLY major ranker to cover animal testing, while Bloomberg & KLD were the ONLY ones to comply with environmental regualtions.\u00a0\n\nAnd look, I understand that this shit can be tough to keep consistent and other shit is tougher to quantify, so fair enough. One Invesco fund manager Clive Emery talked about how metrics used in ESG scores like implied temperature rise (ITR) are hard to distill as one number; this is especially tough as the FCA (the UK\u2019s version of the SEC) has been pushing for firms to include that ITR number in their metrics. Emery summed it up pretty neatly:  \n\n\n> **The funds industry has only JUST\u00a0 learned how to forecast quarterly earnings, let alone reduction of carbon emissions over a 30-year time horizon.\u2019**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd tough as fuck it is. But regardless, if ESG scoring is so difficult, then why the fuck have banks dragged their feet on adding more staff to support these \u201ctough jobs\u201d. **In fact, Funds Europe had one fund manager tell them it was JUST hiring its FIRST full-time employee to double check climate-risk modelling. And they only did that, because\u2013to their credit\u2013they said that the info and models were simply too advanced or difficult to be able to confirm whether the ESG scores were anything more than a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d otherwise.**\u00a0\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nSo unless you have a FT employee running the numbers (mind you, even if that\u2019s just ONE person) that\u2019s still not enough to keep ahead of risk. For those of you that remember 2008, some have even compared the \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d that ESG scoring as similar to the VaR scoring (value at risk). (I wrote in the past about one such example or poor VaR, and how Societe Generale\u2019s fucked VaR positions on their naked/unhedged positions cost them billions during 2008 and created Jerome Kerviel, the world\u2019s poorest man who owes billions due to his poor bets as a \u201crogue trader\u201d for the French bank.)\n\n**So why the worry? Well, these new Climar VaR models might not mean much to a smaller public firm, but mean a shit ton if a giant polluter is also fucking with their implied temperature rise number (while banks are willing to rate them as such as look the other way).**\u00a0\n\n# 8. Under the Hood\n\nSo fine, we know there are problems with ESG scoring. What are the biggest ones then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One is that because agency ratings literally often are based on PUBLIC reporting which often comes through annual reporting cycles, it often might not line up in terms of having a more regular up-to-date ranking. You could hugeeee months\u2019 worth of gaps between a company updating you on how its ESG stuff is doing, and from when a ratings agency decides to update their rankings.\u00a0All the while, investors aren't privy to accurate ratings, much less the \"special sauce\" of how its been calculated and if that metric changed.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[pictured: ESG ratings agencies](https://preview.redd.it/t14o0fchj7791.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d698cfc347b9693ecd2c6d7fb2d31518626acb1)\n\nAlso, raters often don\u2019t distinguish between disclosure vs. performance (\u201chow much carbon do you emit\u201d VS \u201cwhat did you do to fix this?\u201d), making it easier to hide this info. Because many of these methodologies are viewed like KFC special recipe and pRoPriEtARy, it gets even harder to justify. One transparency report went mask off on this issue:\n\n>  \n\u201cIt has been argued that an increasing amount of capital is misallocated due to the inadequacy of ESG criteria and the ESG services market\u2019s lack of transparency. The rankings produced by ESG rating agencies create a false sense of security *(there it is again!)*, and investors who buy into ESG funds with dubious credibility need protection.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 9. Protect Me bby\n\nProtection might be what investors need most.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: not the SEC](https://preview.redd.it/us0twejtj7791.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd88eeabae943086d195714e579e9b9bdf768bea)\n\n**In 2019, the UK\u2019s FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) published a letter saying that as far as companies applying for ESG labeling, they were \u201cconcerned by the number of poor-quality fund applications we have seen and the impact this may have on consumers\u201d. These potential lies also open these funds for\u2013if they\u2019re caught fucking lying\u2013lawsuits from shareholders under section 90/90A of FSMA for false or misleading statements.**\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s all appreciate this quote on that argument\u2026for\u2026reason:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cConversely, fixation on sustainability at the cost of financial performance could also be a catalyst for disputes. Terry Smith, founder of Fundsmith, in an annual letter to investors noted that *\"Unilever seems to be labouring under the weight of a management which is obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business****\u2026a company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann's mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot\"***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[we all thought it](https://preview.redd.it/otmrj0kwj7791.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10ebc55099b7f917f83679e5411879d923d220b)\n\nIt\u2019s completely different when the firm might go under because of a giant extramarital orgy upon a bed of clubbed baby seals. **And remember, this is problematic because if you might be BUYING ratings, then the pension fund that buys in and says \u201cyay this seems good!\u201d might get fucked.**\u00a0\n\n# 10. Lawyer Up Assholes\n\nIn June 2021, the Internaional Organization of Securities Commissions\u2019 Sustainable Taskforce said there needs to be a \u201cglobal corporate sustainability reporting architecture\u201d that doesn\u2019t rely on a patchwork quilt of what the fuck someone ate for breakfast that morning to drive their decision making. Big banks (like hm, let\u2019s say I don\u2019t know\u2026Deustche and Goldman as examples) have now opened themselves up to liability over these \u201cimprecise\u201d ratings.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Linklaters report on \u201cBanking Litigation\u201d for 2022 identified ESG as 1 key area that might open up big banks to lawsuits, both in the UK and abroad.

It also means \u201cpremium listed companies\u201d must include statements in their annual report as to whether they reported against the UK\u2019s climate task force (or at least why they didn\u2019t).

Goldman is caught in US\u2019 regulators\u2019 cross-hairs that it\u2019s been fucking LYING on mutual fund prospectuses regarding ESG holdings. (Of note, Goldman changed the name of its \u201cBlue Chip Fund\u201d to the \u201cUS Equity ESG Fund\u201d, perhaps running the risk of changing absolutely nothing bu the title.\u201d) And the Goldman digging only followed AFTER finding BNY Mellon guilty of its own ESG bullshit for which the SEC paid them a handslap fine of $1.5 million and then be on their merry way.\n\n# 12. Credit Risk Proxy\n\nSo remember: why lie? Once again, what is a big reason to lie about ESG scores?  \n**Well apart from the fact that good ESG scores are jacked up marketing materials, one recurring statement offers this: good ESG scores = proxy for low risk/good risk management skills.**\n\nMeaning many find that investors are willing to see strong ESG scores as meaning that they have their risk management hats on while they slap these ESG stickers on with a discerning eye. In reality, these ESG scores often end up being anything but that, as they are used to paper over major gaps in risk, as well as cram questionable holdings into portfolios that they can then more easily sell to mutual funds, pensions, 401ks, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn these cases, ESG scoring is something seen as equal to credit risk.  \nSo then it ends up being tough if you are pricing certain metrics\u2013like climate risk\u2013which are veryyyy long-term issues. If earnings projections barely ever go as far as 5 fiscal years down the road, then how can ESG scores cover that time frame, accurately without the elemental bullshit that seems so heavy-handed by so many banks?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ije2v2jmk7791.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=079a89c7ba268d184ffc4d58e54d8fd9dc4e3d4e\n\n**For example, Morningstar\u2013whom we might hear more about in the near future ourselves ahem\u2013puts up an ESG screener to filter out low scores.**\u00a0\n\n**Now what if Morningstar says \u201cdon\u2019t worry about those 1 and 2-star ESG-rated companies, they\u2019re not great\u201d and then we find out later that their ESG scoring metrics were shit or\u2013just like the Volkswagen example\u2013they flat out lied about the upper end of the curve, and every 5-star ESG score is just free-range organic dogshit wrapped in greenwashed catshit?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It gets more problematic when you might determine the near future: John Quinn, founder of the world\u2019s largest business litigation law firm, worries about ESG-pegged pricing mechanism that might trigger in a credit agreement (perhaps credit default swaps?) Does that credit default swap or equivalent item trigger when the score drops, but what if its based on a different methodology/way the score is calculated rather than a palpable change to the company\u2019s work?**\n\nYou see quickly how if credit default swaps ever enter the world how this could be problematic. Let\u2019s hope that never happens.\n\n# 13. It Happened Already\n\nUnfortunately, these already exist. Even last year, one report sounded the warning on how the next wave of danger could from ESG derivatives:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>One potential effect of this trend could be to accelerate a pace of growth\u2026that is already worrying regulators. **On September 20 two economists from the Bank for International Settlements drew an explicit parallel between the growth in ESG products and the increase in private mortgage-backed securities in the approach to the global financial crisis of 2008.\u201d**\n\nWow, yet more 2008 warning signs. FUCKING FUN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kjbuo0dm7791.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbc41e86b162865c9ebd0dbe75eee86988ff4c82\n\n**Even more fun, Bloomberg reported just 2 weeks ago that they\u2019ve even been slapping these ESG symbols onto collateralized debt obligations. Remember what I said about hiding credit risk? I mean, how could you be made at this little baby CDO it comes in \u201cgreen\u201d!**\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Even more fun fact, any ocean based ESG derivatives are called \u201cblue\u201d**. (Fucking gag.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **In fact, many of these so-called \u201cblue bonds\u201d which are linked to ocean conservation projects have come under fire as they might be linked to countries with severe amounts of sovereign debt such as Belize.**\u00a0\n\n**These instruments are then linked to OTHER INSTRUMENTS called (I shit you not) \u201cocean-related sovereign ESG debt swaps\u201d, so think of it as a way to make bets on a country going tits up or not as to whether it can clean up the ocean surrounding it.** (If you thought CDO squareds were bad, then wtf is this shit)\n\n# 14. Criticizing the Critics\n\nNow look: legit criticisms DO exist. For everyone who says Rolling Stone can\u2019t boil down the new Kendrick or new to a single number, yeah the same tough titties show up in ESG scoring. And ESG scoring can still be seen as a necessary evil: yeah, it\u2019s imperfect as fuck but maybe these metrics do matter especially as we view their relevance in securities related to risk management.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it also means that asset allocation can go wrong for both mom-and-pop investors as well as institutional investors. **Especially when you have the same companies pushing these products being fucking raided in banks like Deutsche in Frankfurt, ranking Exxon Mobil as climate friendly, and creating fucking credit default swaps on the goddamn ocean.**\n\n# 15. \"Sooooo\u2026what\u2019s this gotta do with GME?\"\n\nThere\u2019s not much that I can directly tie but some general problems do show up again due to this issue.\u00a0\n\nRecently, ESG scoring powerhouse MSCI admitted: \n\n>  \n\u201cThis topic came to prominence 15 years ago owing to concerns over \u2018empty voting\u2019, under which hedge funds could use long positions combined with short equity swaps to give them voting rights without any economic interest, or vice versa.\u201d\n\nA lot of the same fucking problems that show up in past DD on governance relate to ESG. If you push more ESG products that people eat up, you might have these funds then be able to loan these shares.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For example, MSCI could lie and rate a company like GME as 5-stars so that then pension funds and mutual funds eat that shit up. Then those funds are then incentivized to loan those shares which are then used to dump it into the market. You can then theoretically switch back the rating at the last moment and have had the funds being unintentionally complicit in your scheme.**\n\nTinfoil much? Yeah, sure. But there have already been a number of ESG stories over governance issues. **Most recently, tiny hedge fund Engine No. 1 held Exxon\u2019s feet to the fire in a 2021 shareholder proxy contest, which pushed it to report it would aim for netzero emissions by 2050.**\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iflfc8zsm7791.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f9c00c94bb8f75f75163bf2a408e571be5011c5\n\nAnd MORE IMPORTANTLY, Morgan Stanley\u2019s MSCI\u2013linked to a number of total return swaps I\u2019ve seen myself in my GME research\u2013discussed ESG reporting in long-short portfolios 2 months back:  \n\n\n>  \n\u201cESG reporting frameworks to date have mainly focused on long-only portfolios, which allows for straightforward portfolio ESG aggregation that is easy to understand and interpret. **Short positions have typically been excluded from ESG analysis to date.\u201d**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve talked extensively about how hedge fund (Irish ICAV sub-fund, to be exact) Cooper Creek Partners\u2013which includes an ex-Citadel Surveyor douche\u2013was short GME during the sneeze. (Fun fact, Morgan Stanley of MSCI fame was their counterparty.) However, they also feature prominently-along side many other big banks and hedge funds I might add\u2013on lists of companies that support war.\n\nMSCI\u2019s report said carbon emissions may be the biggest push going forward into the future. Why might this matter?\n\n# 16. Double or Nothing\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve addressed in the GME saga that is time-intensive but could be another way of determining positions is looking backwards. I will hope to address this in a future post, but I\u2019m researching over funds in the past that have held GME either as (1) contract for difference, (2) securities lending, or (3) total return swaps. And I\u2019ve mainly been focusing on funds that are either alternative funds, ICAV sub-funds, or\u2013an idea I\u2019ve tried pushing\u2013long-short equity funds.\n\nLong-short equity funds are exactly what they sound like. They are hedge funds that might invest in a few stocks here, a few stocks there, some they go long (bet for), some they go short (bet against), and some get through into total return swaps.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this is where it gets more complex. Because, as we\u2019ve seen with GME, sticky floor and other stocks, some of these funds engage in securities lending (especially for shorting, as might be seen in long-short funds) which is what happens in long-equity short funds. Why is this a problem? Tell us MSCI!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \n**\u201cComplexity can arise when portfolios engage in securities lending leading to potential double counting of the same emissions between portfolios.** Carbon accounting in this regard will be addressed in more detail in a subsequent analysis\u2026.**Some hedge funds ascribed double counting of emissions as a rationale for netting.**\u00a0  \n>  \n>**Double counting can arise in different scenarios, for example when long only investors engage in securities lending, the stocks and their ESG metrics can be counted in multiple portfolios. It was acknowledged however that current regulations across jurisdictions do not stipulate that emissions of a given company held across portfolios globally require summing to the total company level emissions.** Further analysis on the topic of carbon accounting may be required in follow up research.\u201d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j73l9iy6n7791.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=415a92f59f3ac89afda9fff5e00553aa5645daae\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*(First off, how fucked is it that hedge funds will now go up in arms over double counting emissions, but not rehypothecated treasuries or short stocks being lent? Anyways\u2026)*\n\nWe see that MSCI is aware that in the future, one issue that might come up for hedge funds is how emissions are double counted\u2013or not double counted\u2013among portfolios. This then overcomplicates our future of hedge funds as they garner more and more ESG holdings.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If good ESG scores are a metric for risk and netting kicks in, then maybe certain hedge funds might engage in certain levels of securities lending to either boost the profile (prop up hedge fund) or drop the profile (create a bagholding hedge fund) on who they lend to.**\n\nAnd it still does leave an issue that we apes will have to contend with as we read into short hedge funds\u2019 portfolios in the future:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cAsset owners generally preferred the grossing approach on the basis that the business involvement exposure of all sources of return should be made transparent. For example, an investor may short a company that engages in child labor, but this still implies a portfolio exposure to child labor, regardless of the position\u2019s directionality.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n> **It certainly would not imply that shorting that company \u2018removes\u2019 child labor associated with a long exposure to another company in the portfolio that is implicated in child labor. Asset owners\u2019 views illustrated that the concern for business involvement is about association, and whether the investor is benefitting from the price performance of a firm engaging in specified negative business activities. \u201c**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 17. Post-MOASS Investing\n\nDespite in one report MSCI slobbing knob over SHFs, it did provide one comment in another ESG report to a different tune. MSCI was examining whether it was better to divest (remove your investment) from a company or short it:\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**\u201cThe above indicates that while shorting may be perceived as a similar or a better to divesting owing to the potential to influence the cost of capital, we could not find any economically significant evidence to support this hypothesis.** We repeated this exercise and found similar results during 2021 and between 2020 and 2021, in a period of media spotlight on several cases of activist investor campaigns for large scale coordinated shorting of certain companies.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering which companies they mention, yes they do mention GameStop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And the story of GameStop, whether MSCI was right that maybe some SHFs should have divested vs. shorted in their own way, is still not the biggest worry for a firm locked in inconsistent ESG scoring, all while it worries about how the next generation of short hedge funds will deal with those inconsistent ESG scores affecting their portfolio.**\n\n**Because the story of lies, damned lies, and ESG scores is just as much as story of pre-MOASS times, as it is post-MOASS times.**\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo31p8mjm7791.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d904e6166c29492e360cd94f026c3dbd52f5f28\n\nWhen MOASS happens, and we get our tendies, I am sure many of us wil have a keen eye on what good we can in the world. But just as we are to be ever vigilant in other parts of our lives, we must remain ever vigilant about these post-MOASS times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It would seriously not surprise me if the same banks & hedge funds that caused MOASS due to their fucking crime would engage in pushing both regular investors and apes towards highly ESG-rated items to wash the \u201cstink\u201d of the utter fraud the world will all be witness to.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make the world better now, to get away from just happened!\u201d is something I guess we\u2019ll all say (I\u2019m too lazy to make a more accurate thing I\u2019d say but too lazy at this point lol) all the while these banks and SHFs are herding us as cattle to the next round of lies and deceit, circling us down and further round the drain into the next crisis in part through these kaleidoscopes of fuckery that are ESG funds and their derivatives, too busy to look at the green and blue sunshine being sold to us while the water path smells less of hope, and more of sewage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPt. 2: ???  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9tva6wzg7791.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=29ecd12bac90bcd8220d977e9b5294c32c58a0e6", "Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation\u2014A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.\n\nThis report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.\n\n**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples \n\nTesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: \n\n**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla\u2019s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla\u2019s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. \n\n**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA\u2019s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla\u2019s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. \n\n**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla\u2019s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\\~7x) and Toyota (\\~6x). \n\nTech Companies EV/EBITDA: \n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): \\~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. \n* Apple (AAPL): \\~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.\n\nThese valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. \n\n**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla\u2019s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.\n\n**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla\u2019s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. \n\n**Financial Performance Analysis** \n\nRevenue Growth Deceleration Tesla\u2019s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.\n\nTesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. \n\nPolicy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump\u2019s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. \n\nFree Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. \n\nCompetitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla\u2019s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: \n\n* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. \n* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. \n\nVolkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. \n\n**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** \n\nTesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as \"Full Self-Driving,\" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy \n\n* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. \n   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company\u2019s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.\n*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. \n   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. \n\n**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.\n\n* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. \n\n**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla\u2019s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla\u2019s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. \n\nRegulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological\u2014it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla\u2019s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. \n\nCost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla\u2019s **already declining gross margins**. \n\nReliance on Low Costs: Tesla\u2019s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**\u2014both untenable given Tesla\u2019s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla\u2019s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla\u2019s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle\u2014the holy grail of autonomy\u2014highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla\u2019s competitive edge in the autonomy race. \n\n**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla\u2019s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla\u2019s existing commitments. \n\nDevelopment Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. \n\nCompetition: Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. \n\nOptimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: \n\n**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. \n\nLack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla\u2019s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers\u2014producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla\u2019s financial and technical limitations.\n\nLevel 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. \n\nVehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing\u2014placing further pressure on Tesla\u2019s finances. \n\nFinancial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk\u2019s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla\u2019s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.\n\nInvestor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla\u2019s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on Musk\u2019s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company\u2019s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla\u2019s business strategy. \n\nUnlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla\u2019s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla\u2019s brand reputation**. Tesla\u2019s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla\u2019s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla\u2019s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. \n\nTesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology \n\n* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. \n* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. \n* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. \n\nTesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. \n\n**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. \n\nTesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. \n\n**Legal and Regulatory Risks** \n\n* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. \n* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla\u2019s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla\u2019s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: \n* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. \n* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. \n* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla\u2019s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company\u2019s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. \n* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla\u2019s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. \n* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla\u2019s market share. \n* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. \n* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla\u2019s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. \n* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. \n* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla\u2019s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus\u2014all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. \n\nAs competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla\u2019s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla\u2019s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors. \n\nDisclaimer: This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Curiosity-driven innovation fuels the development of new technologies and processes which has the potential to significantly improve people's lives by making tasks more efficient, solving complex problems, and enhancing overall well-being. From medical advancements to renewable energy, technology has allowed us to push the boundaries of what we previously thought possible. Social innovation, which focuses on solving social issues and improving the well-being of individuals and communities, leads to more just and equitable societies. Environmental innovation is aimed at mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, and promoting the sustainability of our planet and its resources.\n\nProfit motive, while ostensibly driving innovation in many industries, causes companies to prioritize their bottom line over the well-being of workers, consumers, and the environment, leading to innovative methods *of profit seeking*. I want to clarify that it's not accurate to say that curiosity, social, and environmental innovation are not important in a capitalist society. In fact, they can and do exist within a capitalist framework, and they can have significant positive impacts on society and the economy. However, it's also true that profit-driven innovation is often prioritized in a capitalist system, which comes at the expense of these other forms of innovation.\n\nThere are many examples of innovation that have come about because of the capitalist profit motive that, while innovating the acquisition and accumulation of wealth, do substantial harm to the environment, the consumer, and the labor force. While there are many examples of victimized groups I will limit my argument to these three.\n\nOne area of innovation with environmental consequences from profit innovation is through innovative methods of fossil fuel procurement despite alternative and renewable sources of energy being available. Here are some examples of these innovations harming the environment in the name of profit:\n\n* [Offshore Drilling](https://www.cbf.org/issues/offshore-drilling/index.html)\n* [Fracking](https://www.wilderness.org/news/article/truth-about-fracking-and-environment)\n* [Mountaintop Removal Mining](https://earthjustice.org/features/campaigns/what-is-mountaintop-removal-mining)\n\nMore generally, profit-seeking behavior can have detrimental effects on wildlife populations and biodiversity:\n\n* [Deforestation](https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/effects-of/deforestation)\n* [Overfishing](https://www.edf.org/oceans/overfishing-most-serious-threat-our-oceans)\n* [Pesticides and Herbicides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2984095/)\n* [Dam building](https://www.americanrivers.org/threats-solutions/restoring-damaged-rivers/how-dams-damage-rivers/)\n\nThreatening biodiversity risks [Human Extinction](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/03/stop-biodiversity-loss-or-we-could-face-our-own-extinction-warns-un)\n\nIf harming the environment and risking human extinction doesn't make your socks roll up and down, there are much more tangible impacts that can be seen from the perspective of the consumer. One of the oft repeated arguments in favor of capitalism and the profit motive is the benefit to the customer, however many innovations have directly led to active harm of the consumer in the name of profit. There are many mechanisms for this, but fostering addiction or obfuscating harmful effects of products are some of the most rampant. These include:\n\n* [Increasing Cigarette Addictiveness](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/chemicals-every-cigarette)\n* [Manufacturing Dopamine Response in Gambling](https://theconversation.com/designed-to-deceive-how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain-91052)\n* [Engineering Fast Food for Addiction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999689/)\n* [The Opioid Epidemic](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116hhrg43010/html/CHRG-116hhrg43010.htm)\n\nFinally, there is the impact on the labor force. Modern capitalism has grown quite adept at creating novel and innovative ways to suppress workers\u2019 rights, wages, and quality of life. Examples of these innovations include:\n\n* [McDonald\u2019s Threatening Automation in Response to Wage Complaints](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/former-mcdonalds-ceo-threatens-replace-employees-robots)\n* [Gig Economy Exploiting Workers](https://niwr.org/our-work/gig-economy/)\n* [Dehumanizing Workplace Surveillance Practices](https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/workplace-surveillance-is-becoming-the-new-normal-for-u-s-workers/)\n* [Workers Killed by Robots](https://www.sciencealert.com/volkswagen-worker-grabbed-and-killed-by-robot-in-german-plant) \n\nThis is far from comprehensive, but I believe the point is clear. The argument that profit motive causes innovation, and that innovation is good, is a reductive argument. Innovation is not an ideal in and of itself, and the varieties of innovation and the motives for those innovations each lead to different outcomes benefitting different groups. The existence and prioritization of profit as the primary motive for society leads to horrifying impacts for the environment, consumers, and workers. Again, this does not discount the existence of alternative motivations for innovation within a capitalist framework, simply an indictment of profit as the primary motive, necessarily sidelining incentives that don't uniquely benefit corporations and shareholders.", "#NIOCORP ~ Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program quick post.... # JUNE 21, 2024 Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program\n\n[Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/qualifying-advanced-energy-project-credit-48c-program)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jefr6bovow7d1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbb2125f4ac8a5c557b6b78c9ceabb93da318caa\n\n# **INTERESTING BACK ON APRIL 18th , 2024 NioCorp Plans to Investigate Feasibility of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling\n\n[NioCorp Plans to Investigate Feasibility of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-plans-to-investigate-feasibility-of-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-recycling/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls0ak293pw7d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2120dc804e170103d00d90f2938ab7a1bc74428\n\n**CENTENNIAL, Colorado \u2013**\u00a0April 18, 2024 \u2013 NioCorp Developments Ltd.

Smith, CEO and Executive Chairman of NioCorp.\u00a0 \u201cRecycling post-consumer rare earth magnets adds to the strategic value of the particular critical minerals processing approach we intend to deploy in Nebraska.\u201d\n\nScott Honan, NioCorp\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, added:\u00a0 \u201cThe process flow sheet that we have designed for the Elk Creek Project may be able to recycle rare earth magnets with virtually no changes to its current configuration, other than to expand the facility\u2019s rare earth separations capacity at the end of the process.\u00a0 That would make for an efficient and relatively rapid solution to establishing a robust magnet recycling capacity in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMr. Honan added: \u201cRare earth permanent magnets come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and formulations, which makes direct recycling very challenging.\u00a0 These magnets are inherently brittle and are typically coated with other metals to prevent corrosion.\u00a0It is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the magnet from its coating, and the coatings can make reprocessing challenging and costly.\u00a0 However, we believe the Elk Creek process can take the magnet and the coatings at a coarse particle size, separate the magnetic rare earth elements from the coating materials, and deliver high purity, fully separated oxides at a very high recovery rate.\u201d\n\nIf NdFeB magnet recycling feasibility is successfully demonstrated through this program, and if NioCorp receives sufficient project financing to construct its planned Elk Creek Project facility, NioCorp may be able to increase its planned production of neodymium-praseodymium oxide, dysprosium oxide, and terbium oxide beyond what may be contained in the Elk Creek ore body.\u00a0 As no economic analysis has been completed on the rare earth mineral resource comprising the Elk Creek Project, further studies are required before determining whether extraction of rare earth elements can be reasonably justified and is economically viable after taking account of all relevant factors.\n\n**Qualified Persons:**\u00a0\n\nScott Honan, M.Sc., SME-RM, COO of NioCorp Developments Ltd., a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information and verified the data contained in this news release.\n\n# JUNE 20th, 2024 ~The energy transition will need critical minerals and metals. Here's how to mine responsibly\n\n  \n[The energy transition will need critical minerals and metals. Here's how to mine responsibly | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/06/energy-transition-critical-minerals-mining/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5f321oxww7d1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7876bee786c800028cc03d95de57c9e0aa2bc0df\n\n* A renewable energy future will require large scale-up of critical minerals and metals, but it will be less resource-intensive than today\u2019s fossil fuel-based energy system.\n* As an industry with both significant impacts and benefits, mining needs to seek and maintain social license to operate.\n* Companies looking to mine responsibility can look to a growing number of international standards and guidelines.\n\nA renewable energy transition will increase demand for critical minerals and metals, such as lithium, copper, manganese and rare earth elements. The market for key energy transition minerals has already\u00a0[doubled over the past five years,](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/c7716240-ab4f-4f5d-b138-291e76c6a7c7/CriticalMineralsMarketReview2023.pdf)\u00a0and the total demand for these materials in clean energy technologies is expected to\u00a0[increase between twofold or fourfold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions)\u00a0by 2040.\n\nWhile continued growth will require more materials mining, the total amount of extraction needed to build a world that runs entirely on green energy by 2040 is far lower than that needed to maintain a fossil-fuelled energy system. In addition, energy production from fossil fuels needs continuous supply flows for combustion and is non-recyclable, whereas critical materials for energy transition are installed in equipment that can be used for years and then recycled at end of product life. While the renewable energy transition will lead to a decrease in extracted materials, it is vital that we ensure these metals are mined responsibly.\n\nOne key metal for which demand will grow more than most others in absolute terms is copper. This is due to its wide range of applications, unique conductive properties and ubiquitous use in electrification technologies. Consequently, annual copper demand is forecast to increase\u00a0[from 25 million tonnes currently to 55.1 million tonnes in 2050](https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/red-metal-green-demand-coppers-critical-role-in-achieving-net-zero/)\u00a0under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. New supplies will be needed to close the demand gap and avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n# Availability of metals\n\nThe good news is that the required volumes of many metals are geographically well-distributed in known terrestrial reserves.\u00a0[Copper is distributed](https://mc-cd8320d4-36a1-40ac-83cc-3389-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2023/Jul/IRENA_Geopolitics_energy_transition_critical_materials_2023.pdf?rev=420aeb58d2e745d79f1b564ea89ef9f8)\u00a0across Chile (23.6%), Peru (10%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (10%), China (8.6%), the United States (5.9%), and several other countries.\n\nIn the short term, the volumes of copper and most metals will come primarily from the same countries that mine them today, as it typically takes 10+ years to open new commercial mining operations. Processing capacity can be geographically diversified much faster than finding new mining locations with sound investment conditions and infrastructure. The US and the EU are implementing new initiatives and standards to promote the development of domestic mining operations and are also establishing strategic partnerships with other countries to build up new supply.\n\n# Mining\u2019s social license\n\nMining can disrupt large amounts of land, impacting biodiversity and ecosystems. It also uses vast quantities of water and creates tailings. In some cases, there have been catastrophic events that have had a major impact on human and environmental health, including the tailings dam failures at Samarco in 2015 and Brumadinho in 2019, both in Brazil.\n\nIn certain instances, both mining and processing can create emissions that can be harmful to the environment and human health. Mining is inherently regional \u2013 you can\u2019t change where the deposit is, and the vast majority of mines are located within or adjacent to Indigenous Peoples territories or local communities. Just over 50% of the metals required for renewable energy transition are on or near Indigenous lands.\n\nHealth and safety, opportunities for employment and procurement, and protecting the rights of local and Indigenous Peoples are paramount. If these issues aren\u2019t managed properly, they can create pushback by impacted communities.\n\n# Mining the responsible way\n\nThe first way to do responsible mining is through robust internal management systems, strong corporate governance and a well-established process for dialogue and grievances. The second is by implementing and getting external assurance against recognized standards.\n\nThere are a number of standards currently in practice: for example, the Mining Association of Canada\u2019s\u00a0[Towards Sustainable Mining programme](https://tsminitiative.com/members), covering biodiversity, climate change, crisis management, mine closure, Indigenous and community relations, among others.\n\nAnother standard is the\u00a0[Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance](https://responsiblemining.net/)\u00a0(IRMA), which was developed by a multistakeholder board and is being implemented in South America and Africa. A final example is the\u00a0[CopperMark](https://coppermark.org/), an independent assurance framework to promote responsible practices across the copper, molybdenum, nickel and zinc value chains.\n\nWhile these standards differ in their approach, they all share the same intent of improving the state of mining around the world. Regardless of the evaluation method, one fundamental aspect to responsible mining for the energy transition is transparency and reporting, with a\u00a0[new GRI standard](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/standards-development/sector-standard-for-mining/)\u00a0for mining to guide the way.\n\n# JUNE 20th 2024~ Toshiba, Sojitz and CBMM Unveil an Ultra-Fast Charging Electric Bus Prototype Powered by Next-Generation Lithium-ion Batteries with Niobium Titanium Oxide Anodes\n\n[Toshiba, Sojitz and CBMM Unveil an Ultra-Fast Charging Electric Bus Prototype Powered by Next-Generation Lithium-ion Batteries with Niobium Titanium Oxide Anodes | News | Toshiba (global.toshiba)](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2024/06/news-20240620-01.html)\n\nArax\u00e1, Brazil and Tokyo, Japan \u2013 Toshiba Corporation and Sojitz Corporation of Japan, and Brazil\u2019s CBMM, the world\u2019s leading producer of niobium, have completed development of a next generation lithium-ion battery that uses niobium titanium oxide (NTO) in the anode. They today held an opening ceremony and unveiled a prototype E-bus powered with the new battery, which realizes an ultra-fast charge time of around 10 minutes and delivers high energy density. The bus has started testing and demonstration operations at CBMM\u2019s industrial plant in Arax\u00e1, Brazil.\n\nThis marks the world\u2019s first operation^(\\*)\u00a0of a prototype e-vehicle powered by a lithium-ion battery with NTO anodes, further paving the way to battery commercialization. The three companies will continue to work together to maximize the use of their respective technologies and knowledge, toward launching the next-generation lithium-ion battery with NTO anode in the global market in Spring 2025.\n\n[Toshiba, Sojitz and CBMM unveiled the prototype of an ultra-fast charging electric bus powered by next-generation lithium-ion batteries with NTO anodes at CBMM\u2019s industrial plant in Arax\u00e1, Brazil. \\(From left, Toshihiko Takaoka, VP of Toshiba's Battery Division; Ricardo Lima, CEO of CBMM; Koichi Yamaguchi, President & CEO for the Americas of Sojitz Corp.; Yutaka Sata, CTO of Toshiba.\\)](https://preview.redd.it/h2917zfoww7d1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c579cdcc0edf1920392c58bfb6e37aef249834b)\n\nThe NTO battery-powered E-bus was developed by Volkswagen Truck & Bus, Brazil, a pioneer in the development and mass production of electric trucks in Latin America. The prototype will also be tested at CBMM\u2019s industrial plant to provide invaluable data on the characteristics of the NTO battery and vehicle operation data, and support any adjustments needed for commercialization.  \n\n\nNTO has twice the theoretical volume density of the graphite-based anode generally used in lithium-ion batteries, which prompted the three companies to sign a joint agreement to explore its potential in June 2018. They subsequently signed a joint development agreement in September 2021 that extended their collaboration to mass production processes of next-generation batteries, mainly targeting application in commercial e-vehicles. In August 2023, the three companies entered into a broad joint sales and marketing agreement that covered building a supply chain and promoting sales and marketing activities, and subsequently, in May this year, at a ceremony attended by representatives of the Brazilian and Japanese governments, they signed a memorandum of understanding on strengthening the supply chain and business promotion.\n\nToshihiko Takaoka, Vice President of the Battery Division at Toshiba Corporation said, \u201cI am very pleased to see an E-bus equipped with our NTO battery, SCiB\u2122 Nb. In partnership with CBMM and Sojitz, Toshiba has implemented the practical use of niobium in battery material applications with the development of an NTO battery that recharges quickly and delivers high energy density. We will continue the development work to expand our SCiB\u2122 battery lineup and business\u201d.\n\nKoichi Yamaguchi, Senior Managing Executive Officer and President & CEO for the Americas of Sojitz Corporation said, \u201cSojitz, as one of CBMM's shareholders and CBMM's sole agent for the Japanese market, has been building a stable raw material supply system and cultivating applications. Through this demonstration, we are very confident that the NTO battery brings the market a new solution for the electrification of the mobilities and other applications. Taking advantage of our global sales networks and an operational presence in a wide range of industries, we, Sojitz, will play major roles in the project with regards to supply chain management as well as accelerating business development including sales activities.  \n  \nRog\u00e9rio Ribas, Technical Head of Battery Program at CBMM said, \u201cThe use of niobium oxide in the anode of lithium-ion batteries brings special characteristics for this component. As it hosts lithium at an inherently stable voltage, it provides safer and more efficient operation. In addition, due to its open crystalline structure, which facilitates the intercalation of lithium, it allows a full recharge in less than 10 minutes, without causing damage to the battery. Due to these unique characteristics, niobium-containing batteries are safer and have a much longer lifespan than traditional batteries\u201d.\n\n\n\n# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:\n\n\"Quick post this morning to see IF it goes through.... \"Experienced some technical difficulties on earlier post...??\" Also sent out some new questions & will share responses.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03knj5nzvw7d1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=90521f84b5014fbf59174bf2541031c66782afa0\n\nChico", "Will this be a game-changer in the lithium mining world?

I have made some small profits of it but didn\u2019t do my DD earlier, got it already 1 month  on my watchlist and was a little bit late to step in. In October this stock was only around  $0.05 and now surged past $3 in only a few  months. I feel like I have missed this train so I did some research on  the internet to catch the same train as ALPP and came Lake Resources NL   (ASX:LKE, OTC: LLKKF) across. I did some DD and was quite positive  about this company and I think it got potential in longer terms (they  are still in the early stages) Same as ABML =)\n\nCurrently,   there is not much to find or to talk about this company on platforms  like Reddit, Yahoo Finance, or Stocktwits, so I want to start to put it in a spotlight here to share my and your thoughts/opinions about this company and if it is worth it to invest in this stock. (of course, do   your own DD before buying stocks)\n\nSummarized,   why I think this stock has so much potential is because the technology they use will be a game-changer in the lithium mining world.  It will **reduce the time** from brine extraction **from months/years to few hours!** It is **sustainable**, **low costs efficient**. It is backed by **Bill gates** and somewhere in a video I'm not sure, but I also heard the name **Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma?**. They own many lakes to operate in it.\n\nTheir  next milestone is waiting for the sample results they send to their partner Novonix (NVNXF). They will be given a PR soon about it,  somewhere in February.\n\nBefore  I  want to get into the company details, let me show you the current state/background of the lithium mining world. I collected some articles and put them together. (sources can be provided)\n\n*Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene.* *Lithium production from clay sources* *is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.*\n\n*Lithium is a metal commonly used in batteries like the rechargeable ones found in laptops, cellphones, and electric cars as well as in ceramics and  glass. It is the lightest metal on Earth and is soft enough to be cut with a knife when in its elemental form.*\n\n*Demand has soared in recent years as carmakers move toward electric vehicles, as* *many countries including the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Canada* *announce a phase-out of combustion-engine cars. In fact,* *five times more lithium than is mined currently is going to be necessary to meet global climate targets by 2050*, according to the World Bank.\n\n*But there\u2019s one big problem. Obtaining lithium by conventional means takes  its own environmental toll, or rather three: carbon emissions, water and  land.*\n\n*Lithium is currently sourced mainly from hard rock mines, such as those in   Australia, or underground brine reservoirs below the surface of dried lake beds, mostly in Chile and Argentina. Hard rock mining \u2013 where the mineral is extracted from open pit mines and then roasted using fossil  fuels \u2013 leaves scars in the landscape, requires a large amount of water and releases 15 tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of lithium, according to  an analysis by the raw materials experts Minviro for the lithium and geothermal energy firm Vulcan Energy Resources. The other conventional option, extracting lithium from underground reservoirs, relies on even more water to extract the lithium \u2013 and it takes place in typically very water-scarce parts of the world, leading to indigenous communities questioning their sustainability.*\n\n*Extracting lithium from geothermal waters \u2013 found not just in Cornwall, but   Germany and the US as well \u2013 has a tiny environmental footprint in comparison, including very low carbon emissions.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4lh2h3wshe61.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=f04cd49bfeb62ca96d7711b6b07aa92b45d79b09\n\n*Geothermal brine is a hot, concentrated saline solution that has circulated through very hot rocks and become enriched with elements such as lithium, boron and potassium. In other words, the energy-intensive process of extracting lithium from solid rock is powered by naturally occurring geothermal energy. The brine in the Cornish mines has concentrations of up to 260 milligrams per litre, flowing at a rate of between 40-60 litres (8.1 to 13.7 gallons) per second. That works out as about enough lithium for a typical smartphone battery (2-3g) passing through the production process every few seconds, according to Cornish   Lithium\u2019s estimates.*\n\n*The demand for lithium with a lower environmental footprint appears to be gaining ground. There are signs car manufacturers including   Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are starting to think about the environmental and social impact of their electric vehicle supply chain,   says Alex Keynes, clean vehicles manager at Brussels-based campaign organisation Transport and Environment. Using lithium that is already in circulation \u2013 from recycled batteries and electronics \u2013 is preferable to mining more, says Keynes. \u201cGiven the enormous demand we\u2019re likely to see over the coming years, \\[it\\] is going to mean we need some extraction, and recovering lithium from geothermal brine looks very promising,\u201d says Keynes.*\n\n*The   speed of lithium extraction from brine deposits could be significantly increased using a technique recently developed by an international  team of scientists.*\n\n*The new filtration technique mimics the capabilities of living cells and has been tailored specifically to filter lithium ions in an \u201cultra-fast,   one-directional and highly-selective manner\u201d.*\n\n*According to the researchers, the technology \u2014 which remains in an early stage \u2014   could one day reduce lithium-from-brine extraction times from several months to just a matter of hours*\\*.\\*\n\n*They   have said they are hopeful the technique will be able to provide \u201ca   clear roadmap for resource recovery\u201d, as well as for other uses such as   \u201clow-energy water purification\u201d \u2014 noting the particular* *benefit of greater lithium availability to \u201cenabling electric vehicles and grid integration of renewable energy sources*\\*\u201d.\\*\n\n*It is the* *latest in a series of lithium extraction technology breakthroughs*\\*,   as researchers around the world seek ways to make access to this increasingly-important mineral easier and more cost-effective.\\*\n\n**The company**\n\nLake   Resources NL (ASX:LKE, OTC: LLKKF) is a clean lithium developer utilizing direct extraction technology for production of sustainable ,   high purity lithium from its flagship Kachi Project within the Lithium   Triangle in Argentina among other projects covering 200,00 ha. This   direct extraction method delivers a solution for two rising demands of electric vehicle batteries \u2013high purity battery materials to avoid  performance issues, and more sustainable, responsibly sourced materials.\n\n1   Clean-Tech: Efficient, disruptive, cost-competitive technology using well-known water treatment re-engineered for lithium (not mining).

Pre-feasibility study   by tier 1 engineering firm shows large, long-life low-cost   operation(refer ASX announcement 28April2020)\n\nAn innovative direct extraction technique, based on a well-used ion exchange water treatment method, has been tested for over 18 months in partnership with Lilac Solutions, with a pilot plant module in   California operating on Kachi brines and has shown 80-90% recoveries.   Battery quality lithium carbonate(99.97% purity)has been produced from   Kachi brine samples with very low impurities (refer ASX announcement 20   October 2020). The first samples of high purity (99.97%purity) battery quality lithium carbonate is being tested in a NMC622 battery by Novonix.   Hazen will produce further samples for downstream supply chain participants and off-takers.\n\nThis method of producing high purity lithium can revolutionize and disrupt the battery materials supply industry as it\u2019s scalable, low cost, and delivers a consistent product quality.\n\n[http://www.lakeresources.com.au/home](http://www.lakeresources.com.au/home)\n\nSo far I figured out companies like Energy X and Vulcan Energy Resources having plans to commercialize this kind of technology.

Revenue of 1 MT is around (non  premium  lithium)17.000 aud.  17.000x100.000 = 1,7B annual revenue. What makes their market cap around 15B.\n\nCurrent  mc is 296m.   15000/296= 50,7x. Current share price x multiply (0,295 x  50,7) = \\~$15. So  around 2022-2024 a potential realistic share price could go to $15.  This price may even go higher if their pure lithium can sell for a higher price and might be listing in the NASDAQ or maybe a  merge, partner announcements, extension other lake projects?\n\nI expect it will go pass $0,50 after releasing sample results from Novonix.\n\nBe patience!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t13g3q6qvhe61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a87865ebb775e2464419b46340ddb6a6e8ef138\n\nVulcan energy resources with this  similar kind of technology has surged pass 4 euro in a month since I  mentioned in the DD above (ss on 23 dec).\n\nThat is 7000% gains YTD ATH!!\n\nWill LKE act the same???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qaxzc3dpwhe61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=967d9c52f1529a0a84766f22a3fe668aa8433901\n\nHope this post was informative for you.

Or is there an EV bubble? Hello all,\n\nGreetings from London.\n\nI would love to get some opinions on [this interesting piece on the \"Tesla-financial complex](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0)[\" in the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0).\n\nI found this article immensely fascinating and disturbing too. I have a few points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I think Warren Buffet & Charlie Munger will be proven right on the growing WSB-Gamestop-Robinhood gambling culture that seems pervasive. I was shocked that the article specifically mentioned Reddit. And, just a few days ago, someone messaged me on reddit about Alibaba saying \"the hedgies will have to cover their shorts\". I think the ridiculous culture and mania and language of WSB has more pronounced than people realise. And the use of leveraged-instruments to exacerbate a mania/bubble is exactly what Warren Buffett warned about in the 1990s.\n* Reading this article, there seems to be parallels with the crash of 1929. The widespread greed and speculation that has the power to spill into the broader market.\n\nI have pasted the article below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The \u2018Tesla-financial complex\u2019: how carmaker gained influence over the markets](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0)\n\nThe rally in Tesla\u2019s shares has lifted the overall stock market value of Elon Musk\u2019s electric carmaker to over $1.1tn, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. This year alone it has added almost $475bn in market capitalisation, equal to a Procter & Gamble, a JPMorgan \u2014 or two McDonald\u2019s.\n\nHowever, the real importance and wider footprint of what might be called the \u201cTesla-financial complex\u201d far outstrips the company\u2019s market capitalisation. This is thanks to a vast, tangled web of dependent investment vehicles, corporate emulators and an enormous associated derivatives market of unparalleled breadth, depth and hyperactivity.\n\nCombined, these factors mean Tesla\u2019s influence over the ebb and flow of the stock market is far greater than even its size would imply. It may even be historically unrivalled in its wider impact, some analysts say.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the language to describe Tesla any more,\u201d says Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s like explaining to a person in a two-dimensional world the concept of \u2018up\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla-financial complex is a phenomenon that many investors \u2014 whether passive index funds, traditional mutual funds, hedge funds or ordinary retail investors \u2014 have no choice but to contend with, given the idiosyncratic force it now exerts over the stock market.\n\n\u201cIt stands out like a sore thumb,\u201d says Dean Curnutt, the chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to pay a lot of attention to.\u201d\n\nOne of Tesla\u2019s oddest quirks is the fuel that has helped power its rocketing stock market value. Although its stock is wildly popular with many ordinary retail investors, the swelling size and hyperactivity of Tesla \u201coptions\u201d \u2014 popular derivatives contracts that allow investors to bet both on and against a stock and magnify any gains and losses \u2014 has also flabbergasted many market veterans.\n\nThe nominal trading value of Tesla options has averaged $241bn a day in recent weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That compares with $138bn a day for Amazon, the second most active single-stock option market, and $112bn a day for the rest of the S&P 500 index combined. This makes Tesla\u2019s stock more prone to whipsaw movements, because of the \u201cleverage\u201d inherent in using options to trade.\n\n\u201cThe Tesla options volume has always been outsized, but it is now huge,\u201d says Michael Golding, the US head of trading at Optiver, a firm active in the options market. \u201cTesla almost represents a generation. It\u2019s come to represent innovation, at a time when option trading has taken off.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla options market \u2014 more than 60 times as active as the entire FTSE 100 options market, and almost seven times greater than Euro Stoxx 50 options \u2014 has helped push US option trading volumes above actual stock trading volumes this year.\n\nTesla accounts for a big chunk of that aberration. In November options trading was 50 per cent higher than stock trading in nominal terms, and without Tesla and Amazon it would have been 20 per cent lower, according to Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe combination of a high market cap and extraordinary option activity make Tesla a critical driver,\u201d the investment bank said in a note.\n\nGolding estimates that historically the combined trading activity in US equity options has been between 10 and 20 times larger than activity in the biggest individual equity options market. However, there have been days recently where Tesla\u2019s option trading activity has been five-to-six times the rest of the S&P 500 options ecosystem combined. \u201cThe size of the Tesla options market is absolutely enormous,\u201d he says.\n\nThe value of options depend on what the underlying shares do, but due to their complex mechanics analysts say the option tail can occasionally wag the equity dog if there is enough activity in them, and even bleed into the broader stock market \u2014 adding to its churn and making it harder to navigate for many investors.\n\nCurnutt points out that it is unprecedented to have such a huge stock that is also so volatile, and moves to the beat of its own drum. For example, the swelling heft of Tesla\u2019s stock and options market is one of the reasons why the Vix volatility index has diverged so sharply from actual US equity market volatility lately, he argues. \u201cTesla is its own animal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changes how markets price risk.\u201d\n\n**Who will bet against Tesla?**\n\nOrdinary retail investors have been the primary power behind the Tesla options boom, but some of them have more resources to make bigger leveraged bets on Musk\u2019s company than others.\n\nIT billionaire Leo KoGuan recently said that he had by early November accumulated almost 7.2m shares in Tesla. They had largely been accumulated through aggressive purchases of Tesla call options \u2014 which give buyers the right to buy shares at a pre-agreed price within a certain time period \u2014 and offer a popular route to boost gains. Bloomberg previously verified the growing size of his direct equity stake and options investments, and in September, Tesla\u2019s investor relations head Martin Viecha confirmed KoGuan\u2019s original claim.\n\nThat would make him Tesla\u2019s third-biggest individual shareholder, behind Musk and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, with a stake worth almost $8bn, and has made him a hero on Reddit forums dedicated to the carmaker and trading. \u201cLeo KoGuan = Tesla God\u201d, one thread declared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trading a lot of options, we can definitely see his footprint in the market and he\u2019s inspiring others,\u201d Golding says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s waving the Tesla flag and people on Reddit see him as someone they can follow.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s fame and the volatility of its stock have also started to make it a component in some structured investment products, such as \u201cauto-callables\u201d, further enmeshing its shares into the fate of the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nAuto-callables are complex savings vehicles \u2014 particularly popular with Asian investors \u2014 where bankers construct an attractive, bond-like fixed return by selling stock options. Historically they have been mostly options on broad stock market indices such as the S&P 500, Hang Seng or Nikkei, but because of falling market volatility some bankers have started to structure them with options on choppier individual stocks. Tesla has emerged as a popular choice.\n\n\u201cTesla is perceived as safe because it is big and at the technological vanguard, but it\u2019s incredibly lucrative \\[for investors\\] to put into structured products because it is so volatile,\u201d says Simplify\u2019s Green.\n\nThe frenetic rally in Tesla has also buoyed money management groups such as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and Baillie Gifford, which have bet heavily on the electric carmaker. But there is a flipside. Its gains have left a huge and growing blot on the performance of many other investors with only negligible or modest positions in Tesla relative to its big heft in their benchmarks \u2014 or \u201cunderweight\u201d in market jargon \u2014 due to what many see as its wildly inflated valuation.\n\nUS mutual funds focused on growth stocks suffered their worst bout of underperformance in at least two decades in October, largely due to the carmaker\u2019s rally. For US mutual fund managers as a whole, Tesla alone crimped their relative performance by 0.46 of a percentage point in October, according to Wells Fargo analysts, helping turn what was heading towards being a decent year into yet another mediocre one for stockpickers.\n\n\u201cManagers that have been underweight Tesla have certainly been punished,\u201d says Drew Dickson, chief investment officer at Albert Bridge Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s been a sizeable driver of underperformance for many. You have to wonder whether a lot of them are now holding it simply due to fears they\u2019re going to lag.\u201d\n\nBetting against Tesla has been particularly painful. Hedge funds that have shorted Tesla shares over the past decade are sitting on cumulative losses of over $60bn, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics company. Just this year the losses have come to $11bn.\n\nThe \u201cshort interest\u201d in Tesla \u2014 the percentage of shares that have been lent out to and sold by hedge funds \u2014 has now fallen from 20 per cent at the start of 2020 to just 3.3 per cent by mid-November, according to S3. A sign, industry insiders say, that fund managers are now reluctant to risk their careers betting against a stock that has defied financial gravity for so long.\n\nProminent bears keep falling by the wayside. Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager made famous by author Michael Lewis in The Big Short and portrayed by Christian Bale in the film of the same name, last year called Tesla\u2019s stock price \u201cridiculous\u201d and revealed that he was shorting it. But in October he said he had ended the trade and closed out the short position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the original meme stock,\u201d says Green, referring to companies like GameStop that have gained sky-high valuations off the back of social media hype. \u201cShorting Tesla is just an ego trade at this stage. Tesla has been a primary contributor to destroying the credibility of active management over the past few years.\u201d\n\n**EV bubble**\n\nUnderscoring its financial idiosyncrasy, Tesla stock tends to not be much affected by other market and economic trends, but correlates somewhat with bitcoin, according to analysis by Quant Insight.\n\nAt the moment Tesla\u2019s shares seem to be benefiting from a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of factors, such as rising inflation expectations, tighter dollar conditions and uncertain credit markets, but \u201cTesla spends a lot of time out of \\[recognisable\\] macro regimes \u2014 unsurprising when it is often driven by idiosyncratic factors like Elon\u2019s tweets,\u201d says Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight. A macro regime is industry jargon for how different economic environments can hurt or help certain stocks or sectors.\n\nThe success of Tesla\u2019s stock has also helped inflate what some analysts and fund managers think is a broader bubble in anything related to electric vehicles. Tesla-emulators Rivian and Lucid are now valued at about $110bn and $90bn, respectively, despite having negligible revenues and no profits.\n\nAn index of EV and electric battery companies compiled by the FT has a combined market capitalisation of almost $1.8tn. In contrast, automotive giants Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai, the biggest car manufacturers in the world, are worth about $254bn, $135bn and $42bn, respectively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a big halo effect with anything electric vehicle-related at the moment, thanks to Tesla,\u201d says Benjamin Bowler, an equity derivatives strategist at Bank of America.\n\nEven Nikola, an electric truck start-up that has set aside $125m to settle fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that it misled investors about its technology, is still valued at $5.4bn. That is enough to qualify it for the blue-chip S&P 500 index \u2014 if it had ever made any profit.\n\nIf Tesla\u2019s ascent continues it will further enrich believers, hurt the dwindling band of doubters and drag swaths of the broader equity market up with it. But if it were to fall sharply, it could cause ripples through financial markets that are far in excess of what many appreciate.\n\nTesla did drop as much as 17.6 per cent in November before rallying once more, without the fall triggering any major ripples. But even this decline only took it back to its October level, and a bigger, more sustained drop could prove more impactful.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge, recursive \u2018tail wagging the dog\u2019 nature to the valuation of a lot of things these days,\u201d says Dickson. \u201cI\u2019m unwavering in my belief that ultimately the fundamentals are what matters. But over the past few years I can see that the short and intermediate term is far more dominated by flow, momentum, memes and appetites.\u201d\n\nHe recalls the financial analyst Ben Graham\u2019s adage that the stock market is a voting machine in the short run, but a weighing machine in the longer run. \u201cIn the current environment, I think we\u2019re spending a lot more time voting,\u201d says Dickson.", "Aptiv PLC Data Collection risks for the doc look here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AlYPZi5AVbLSTB1wupjZOyRjE4zOKo1x4Vyqz-h8dVU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AlYPZi5AVbLSTB1wupjZOyRjE4zOKo1x4Vyqz-h8dVU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Aptiv PLC Data Collection risks\n\n1.

Aptiv's market capitalization as of April 2023 stands at approximately $28 billion, reflecting its substantial market value and industry position. The company's Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, which includes many of the data-driven technologies discussed in this document, accounted for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2020, demonstrating the significant scale of these systems in modern vehicles.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, autonomous, and data-driven, Aptiv's role in the automotive technology landscape continues to grow. The company's vast array of sensors, software platforms, and data management systems are becoming increasingly central to the operation of modern vehicles, raising important questions about data privacy, security, and potential misuse that will be explored further in this document.\n\nHowever, Aptiv's involvement in government contracting and its operation of a data center in China add additional layers of complexity and concern to these issues. The company's access to sensitive government and military data through its Wind River subsidiary, as well as the potential for data hosted in its Chinese data center to be accessed by foreign actors, raise serious questions about the company's data practices and the adequacy of its security measures.\n\nThese concerns are particularly acute given the increasing importance of connected vehicle data for national security, critical infrastructure, and personal privacy. As policymakers and regulators grapple with the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of automotive technology, it is essential that the roles and practices of key industry players like Aptiv be subject to rigorous scrutiny and oversight.\n\nIn the following sections, this document will delve into the specific risks and concerns associated with Aptiv's data collection practices, as well as the broader implications of connected vehicle technology for personal privacy, public safety, and national security. By examining these issues in depth, we hope to contribute to a more informed and robust public dialogue about the future of automotive technology and the steps needed to ensure that its benefits are realized while its risks are effectively mitigated.\n\n1. Sensors, Systems, and Data Collection in Aptiv-Equipped Vehicles\n\nModern vehicles, especially those equipped with Aptiv's advanced technologies, contain a wide array of sensors, systems, and components that collect vast amounts of data and control various vehicle functions. These components are essential for enabling features like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, connected services, and vehicle safety enhancements. However, they also raise important privacy, security, and safety concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data they collect and the control they have over the vehicle.\n\nSome of the key sensors, systems, and data collection components found in Aptiv-equipped vehicles include:\n\n* GPS (Global Positioning System): GPS sensors track the precise location of the vehicle at all times, generating a detailed record of the vehicle's movements and routes.\n* Cameras: Modern vehicles often include multiple cameras, both inside and outside the cabin. These cameras can capture video and images of the vehicle's surroundings, as well as the occupants inside the vehicle.\n* Radar and Lidar: Radar and lidar sensors use radio waves and laser light, respectively, to detect objects and obstacles around the vehicle. They generate detailed 3D maps of the vehicle's environment and are critical for ADAS and autonomous driving features.\n* Accelerometers and Gyroscopes: These sensors measure the vehicle's acceleration, braking, and turning movements. They provide data on the vehicle's motion and driving dynamics.\n* Biometric Sensors: Some advanced vehicle systems include biometric sensors that can monitor the driver's attention level, eye movements, heart rate, and other physiological parameters.\n* Microphones: Many vehicles include microphones for voice commands, hands-free calling, and in-cabin noise cancellation. These microphones can potentially pick up conversations inside the vehicle.\n* Infotainment Systems / Human-Machine Interface (HMI): Modern vehicles feature sophisticated infotainment systems, also known as HMIs, which serve as the central interface for the driver and passengers to interact with the vehicle's features and functions. These systems often include touchscreens, voice controls, and connectivity features like smartphone integration. HMIs can collect and store data on user preferences, usage patterns, and even personal information synced from connected devices.\n* Speaker Systems: Vehicle speaker systems, especially those with advanced features like active noise cancellation or personalized audio zones, can include embedded microphones that monitor the acoustic environment inside the cabin. While primarily used for enhancing audio experience, these microphones could potentially be used for eavesdropping if compromised.\n* Actuators: Vehicles contain numerous actuators that control various functions such as braking, steering, throttle control, and suspension adjustments. In modern vehicles, especially those with ADAS or autonomous driving features, these actuators are often controlled by electronic control units (ECUs) that receive input from various sensors and systems. While essential for vehicle control and safety, the ability to remotely manipulate actuators through compromised ECUs or control systems could pose serious safety risks.\n* Telematics Systems: Telematics systems transmit vehicle data wirelessly to remote servers for analysis and processing. This can include diagnostic information, usage patterns, and even real-time sensor data from the systems mentioned above.\n\nIt is important to note that as a tier-one supplier deeply integrated into the vehicle's systems, Aptiv has access to the data generated by these sensors and components without the explicit knowledge or consent of the end customers (i.e., the vehicle owners or occupants). This raises significant concerns about data privacy, ownership, and control. Customers may be unaware of the extent of data being collected by their vehicles and transmitted to Aptiv, and they may have limited insight into how that data is being used or shared.\n\nThe data generated by these sensors and systems is often highly personal and sensitive in nature. Location data, biometric information, in-cabin audio and video, and personal data from HMIs all raise significant privacy concerns. The ability to control vehicle actuators and manipulate vehicle behavior through compromised systems poses severe safety and security risks.\n\nFurthermore, the transmission and storage of this data, as well as the wireless interfaces used to communicate with vehicle systems, introduce additional vulnerabilities. Malicious actors could potentially intercept sensitive data, take control of vehicle functions, or manipulate vehicle behavior remotely.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe next section will delve into some of the specific risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle sensor data, control systems, and the largely opaque data practices of automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv.\n\n1. Risks and Potential Misuse Cases Associated with Vehicle Data, Control Systems, and Supplier Access\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle data, control systems, and supplier access can be broadly categorized into three main areas: remote viewing, remote communication, and remote sensing. Each of these areas presents unique challenges and threats to individual privacy, security, and autonomy.\n\n1. Remote Viewing\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of modern vehicle technology is the ability for connected systems to enable remote viewing of a vehicle's interior and surroundings. This capability is made possible by the numerous cameras and imaging sensors embedded in today's vehicles, which can capture detailed video and images both inside and outside the cabin.\n\nSome of the key risks and potential misuse cases associated with remote viewing include\n\n* Invasion of Privacy: In-cabin cameras can capture intimate details of a vehicle's occupants, including their facial expressions, behaviors, and personal belongings. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this video feed could enable severe privacy violations and potentially even be used for blackmail or extortion.\n* Stalking and Harassment: Real-time access to a vehicle's interior cameras could be exploited by stalkers, abusers, or other malicious actors to monitor and harass their targets. This is particularly concerning in cases of domestic violence or obsessive behavior, where perpetrators could use remote viewing to track and intimidate their victims.\n* Corporate Espionage: In-cabin cameras could also be misused for corporate espionage, particularly in cases where sensitive business discussions or negotiations take place inside a vehicle. Competitors could potentially gain access to confidential information by remotely monitoring a targeted vehicle's interior.\n* Voyeurism and Exploitation: The ability to remotely view a vehicle's interior could also enable disturbing cases of voyeurism and sexual exploitation. Bad actors could potentially hack into vehicle camera systems to spy on occupants in compromising situations or even record and distribute intimate footage without consent.\n* Surveillance and Monitoring: Remote viewing capabilities could be exploited by governments, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies to conduct invasive surveillance and monitoring of targeted individuals or groups. This could have chilling effects on freedom of speech, association, and political dissent.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to vehicle camera systems. This should include strong encryption, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for clear regulations and guidelines around the use of in-cabin cameras and remote viewing capabilities. This should include strict limits on when and how these features can be used, mandatory disclosure to vehicle occupants when they are being recorded, and robust protections against misuse by law enforcement or government agencies.\n\nConsumers should also be empowered with meaningful control over the cameras and imaging sensors in their vehicles, including the ability to physically disable or cover these components when not in use.\n\nUltimately, while remote viewing capabilities may offer some benefits in terms of safety and convenience, the risks to individual privacy and security are significant. As such, the development and deployment of these technologies must be approached with the utmost caution and transparency, and with the rights and interests of consumers as the top priority.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any of these points or if you have any other suggestions for this section on remote viewing risks. I'm happy to refine the content to ensure it comprehensively addresses the key concerns.\n\n1. Remote Communication\n\nAnother significant risk associated with connected vehicle systems is the ability for remote communication and interaction with a vehicle's internal components and control systems. This includes the capability to update firmware, modify software settings, and even directly control physical actuators like brakes, throttle, and steering.\n\nThese remote communication channels present a wide array of potential attack vectors and misuse cases:\n\n* Malicious Firmware Updates: By compromising the firmware update process, a hacker could potentially install malicious code onto a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs). This could allow them to manipulate vehicle behavior, disable safety features, or even take complete control of the vehicle remotely. Such attacks could be carried out at scale, targeting entire fleets of vehicles simultaneously.\n* Disabling Safety Systems: Hackers could exploit remote communication vulnerabilities to disable critical safety systems like airbags, anti-lock brakes, or electronic stability control. This could be done for malicious purposes, such as causing accidents or facilitating other crimes, or as part of a larger terrorist attack or act of cyberwarfare.\n* Targeted Attacks and Assassinations: The ability to remotely control a vehicle's acceleration, braking, and steering could enable terrifyingly precise targeted attacks. Hackers could potentially cause a specific vehicle to crash, allowing for nearly untraceable assassinations or \"accidental\" deaths.\n* Ransomware and Extortion: By gaining remote control over a vehicle's systems, hackers could effectively hold the vehicle and its occupants hostage. They could demand a ransom payment in exchange for releasing control of the vehicle, or threaten to cause an accident if their demands are not met. This could be particularly effective against fleet vehicles or those belonging to high-value targets.\n* Bot Networks and Distributed Attacks: Compromised vehicles could be used as part of a larger botnet or distributed attack network. Hackers could harness the collective computing power and connectivity of many vehicles to conduct large-scale denial-of-service attacks, mine cryptocurrencies, or spread malware to other connected systems.\n* Theft and Hijacking: Hackers could exploit remote communication channels to unlock and start vehicles remotely, enabling sophisticated theft schemes. They could also potentially hijack vehicles in motion, taking control away from the driver and rerouting the vehicle to a desired location.\n* Privacy Breaches: By accessing a vehicle's communication systems, hackers could potentially intercept sensitive data transmissions, including personal information, location data, and even audio from in-cabin microphones. This could enable identity theft, stalking, or other privacy breaches.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with remote communication are not just theoretical. In a deeply concerning incident, it was revealed that private keys used to secure vehicle communication systems were leaked online. These keys, if obtained by malicious actors, could potentially grant unauthorized access to thousands of vehicles, enabling the kinds of attacks and misuse cases described above.\n\nThe leak of these private keys underscores the urgent need for more robust cybersecurity measures and more transparent disclosure of potential vulnerabilities by automotive technology suppliers. It also raises serious questions about the industry's ability to safeguard the integrity of vehicle systems and protect consumers from cyber threats.\n\nThe risks posed by remote communication vulnerabilities, combined with the demonstrated reality of critical security failures like the leaked private keys, present a grave threat to public safety and national security. As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, the potential impact of these attacks will only continue to grow.\n\nRegulators, industry stakeholders, and the cybersecurity community must come together to address these risks head-on, through a combination of stronger regulations, more robust technical safeguards, and greater transparency and accountability from automotive technology suppliers.\n\nThe leaked private keys incident should serve as a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry, and a catalyst for more aggressive action to secure vehicle systems against cyber threats. This should include a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the leak, as well as a comprehensive review of cybersecurity practices across the industry.\n\nUltimately, the risks associated with remote communication in connected vehicles are complex, multifaceted, and rapidly evolving. Addressing these risks will require sustained collaboration, innovation, and vigilance from all stakeholders. The stakes could not be higher, and the time for action is now.\n\n1. Remote Sensing\n\nIn addition to the risks associated with remote viewing and communication, connected vehicles also present significant concerns related to remote sensing capabilities. Modern vehicles are equipped with a wide array of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors, which can gather detailed information about the vehicle's surroundings and occupants.\n\nFrom a malicious actor's perspective, these remote sensing capabilities could be exploited for a variety of nefarious purposes, posing serious threats to personal privacy, public safety, and even national security:\n\n* Surveillance and Tracking: By accessing a vehicle's external sensors, malicious actors could potentially track the movements of targeted individuals or groups with unprecedented precision. This could enable intrusive surveillance by governments, law enforcement, or private entities, undermining personal privacy and civil liberties.\n* Psychological Operations (PSYOPs): The data gathered by a vehicle's sensors could be used to build detailed psychological profiles of individuals based on their driving habits, frequented locations, and social interactions. This information could be exploited for targeted propaganda, manipulation, or blackmail, enabling sophisticated psychological operations at scale. Moreover, in a disturbing scenario, a malicious actor could potentially use a vehicle's sensors and control systems to actively manipulate the driving experience, causing intentional distress or even fear in targeted individuals. For example, by subtly altering the vehicle's handling, braking, or acceleration, an attacker could create a sense of unease or anxiety in the driver, making them more susceptible to manipulation or coercion. In more extreme cases, an attacker could potentially use a vehicle's systems to create overtly frightening or dangerous situations, such as causing sudden, unexpected braking or swerving, or even staging apparent near-misses or collisions. By inducing a state of heightened stress and fear, an attacker could potentially influence a targeted individual's behavior, decision-making, or even mental health over time. The use of connected vehicles as a tool for psychological manipulation represents a chilling evolution of traditional PSYOPs tactics, enabling a level of targeted, personalized, and persistent influence that has never before been possible. The implications of this for personal autonomy, mental well-being, and even political stability are deeply concerning.\n* Fingerprinting Nearby Devices: A vehicle's wireless communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, could be used to scan for and fingerprint nearby electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices. This could allow for the tracking and identification of individuals based on their digital footprint, even if they are not directly connected to the vehicle.\n* Health Data Exploitation: Some vehicles are equipped with biometric sensors that can monitor a driver's heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological parameters. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this data could be used to infer sensitive health information about individuals, enabling targeted advertising, insurance discrimination, or even blackmail.\n* IoT Device Hacking: A vehicle's sensors could potentially be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in nearby IoT devices, such as smart home appliances, wearables, or industrial control systems. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to these devices, steal sensitive data, or even cause physical harm.\n* Situational Awareness and Control: By aggregating data from multiple vehicles' sensors, malicious actors could gain a highly detailed and real-time understanding of traffic patterns, crowd movements, and other environmental factors. This situational awareness could be used to coordinate terrorist attacks, disrupt emergency response efforts, or even control the flow of people and goods in a given area.\n\nThe risks associated with remote sensing are particularly concerning given the increasing sophistication and range of sensors being integrated into modern vehicles. As autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, the amount and granularity of data collected by these sensors will only continue to grow, amplifying the potential for misuse and abuse.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers and manufacturers implement robust data security and privacy safeguards. This should include strict access controls, encryption of sensor data both at rest and in transit, and secure over-the-air update mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to sensor firmware.\n\nThere is also a need for clear regulatory guidelines and oversight regarding the collection, use, and sharing of vehicle sensor data. Consumers should be given transparent notice of what data is being collected by their vehicles, and have the ability to opt-out of data collection for non-essential functions.\n\nFrom a national security perspective, the risks posed by remote sensing underscore the need for proactive engagement and collaboration between the automotive industry, cybersecurity researchers, and government agencies. This should include the development of robust threat intelligence sharing mechanisms, as well as joint efforts to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities in vehicle sensor systems.\n\nUltimately, the remote sensing capabilities of connected vehicles present both immense opportunities and significant risks. Realizing the benefits of these technologies while mitigating their potential for harm will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, guided by a shared commitment to security, privacy, and the public good.\n\nAs we continue to navigate this complex and rapidly evolving landscape, it is crucial that we remain vigilant to the risks posed by remote sensing and other emerging automotive technologies. By working together to address these challenges head-on, we can build a future in which the transformative potential of connected and autonomous vehicles is realized, without compromising the safety, security, and privacy of individuals and society as a whole.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe rapid evolution of automotive technology, driven by advances in connectivity, automation, and data analytics, is transforming the transportation landscape and creating new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and safety. However, this transformation also poses significant risks and challenges, particularly with respect to data privacy, cybersecurity, and national security.\n\nThis document focuses on the role of Aptiv PLC, a major global automotive technology supplier, in the development and deployment of connected vehicle technologies.

Mining is a long game, especially for junior miner years away from production, but with an outlook such as this I think it's a steal for the currently listed price. As some of your own research, I suggest you take a look at what happened to Piedmont Lithium when they struck an offtake with Tesla (450% up) and Core Lithium with Sichuan Yahua (390% up). Offtake for EMH is imminent so it's possible this bargain won't last.\n\nI'll list some analyst's takes on EMH below for further reading and price targets - I'm not qualified to provide my own.

It is the lightest metal on Earth and is soft enough to be cut with a knife when in its elemental form.*\n\n*Demand has soared in recent years as carmakers move toward electric vehicles, as* *many countries including the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Canada* *announce a phase-out of combustion-engine cars. In fact,* *five times more lithium than is mined currently is going to be necessary to meet global climate targets by 2050*\\*, according to the World Bank.\\*\n\n*But there\u2019s one big problem. Obtaining lithium by conventional means takes its own environmental toll, or rather three: carbon emissions, water and land.*\n\n*Lithium is currently sourced mainly from hard rock mines, such as those in Australia, or underground brine reservoirs below the surface of dried lake beds, mostly in Chile and Argentina. Hard rock mining \u2013 where the mineral is extracted from open pit mines and then roasted using fossil fuels \u2013 leaves scars in the landscape, requires a large amount of water and releases 15 tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of lithium, according to an analysis by the raw materials experts Minviro for the lithium and geothermal energy firm Vulcan Energy Resources. The other conventional option, extracting lithium from underground reservoirs, relies on even more water to extract the lithium \u2013 and it takes place in typically very water-scarce parts of the world, leading to indigenous communities questioning their sustainability.*\n\n*Extracting lithium from geothermal waters \u2013 found not just in Cornwall, but Germany and the US as well \u2013 has a tiny environmental footprint in comparison, including very low carbon emissions.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkiqsfij4tm61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=996a92196e47b76aac2dba20ba81dad1abd3862a\n\n*Geothermal brine is a hot, concentrated saline solution that has circulated through very hot rocks and become enriched with elements such as lithium, boron and potassium. In other words, the energy-intensive process of extracting lithium from solid rock is powered by naturally occurring geothermal energy. The brine in the Cornish mines has concentrations of up to 260 milligrams per litre, flowing at a rate of between 40-60 litres (8.1 to 13.7 gallons) per second. That works out as about enough lithium for a typical smartphone battery (2-3g) passing through the production process every few seconds, according to Cornish Lithium\u2019s estimates.*\n\n*The demand for lithium with a lower environmental footprint appears to be gaining ground. There are signs car manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are starting to think about the environmental and social impact of their electric vehicle supply chain, says Alex Keynes, clean vehicles manager at Brussels-based campaign organisation Transport and Environment.

I wrote this to hopefully reframe this reductive argument and dispel the idea that innovation is universally positive and enjoyed by all.\n\nInnovation driven by curiosity, social responsibility, and environmental concern is crucial for the betterment of society. Curiosity-driven innovation fuels the development of new technologies and processes which has the potential to significantly improve people's lives by making tasks more efficient, solving complex problems, and enhancing overall well-being. From medical advancements to renewable energy, technology has allowed us to push the boundaries of what we previously thought possible. Social innovation, which focuses on solving social issues and improving the well-being of individuals and communities, leads to more just and equitable societies. Environmental innovation is aimed at mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, and promoting the sustainability of our planet and its resources.\n\n\nProfit motive, while ostensibly driving innovation in many industries, causes companies to prioritize their bottom line over the well-being of workers, consumers, and the environment, leading to innovative methods *of profit seeking*. I want to clarify that it's not accurate to say that curiosity, social, and environmental innovation are not important in a capitalist society. In fact, they can and do exist within a capitalist framework, and they can have significant positive impacts on society and the economy. However, it's also true that profit-driven innovation is often prioritized in a capitalist system, which comes at the expense of these other forms of innovation.\n\n\nThere are many examples of innovation that have come about because of the capitalist profit motive that, while innovating the acquisition and accumulation of wealth, do substantial harm to the environment, the consumer, and the labor force. While there are many examples of victimized groups I will limit my argument to these three.\n\n\nOne area of innovation with environmental consequences from profit innovation is through innovative methods of fossil fuel procurement despite alternative and renewable sources of energy being available. Here are some examples of these innovations harming the environment in the name of profit:\n\n\n* [Offshore Drilling](https://www.cbf.org/issues/offshore-drilling/index.html)\n\n* [Fracking](https://www.wilderness.org/news/article/truth-about-fracking-and-environment)\n\n* [Mountaintop Removal Mining](https://earthjustice.org/features/campaigns/what-is-mountaintop-removal-mining)\n\n\nMore generally, profit-seeking behavior can have detrimental effects on wildlife populations and biodiversity:\n\n\n* [Deforestation](https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/effects-of/deforestation)\n\n* [Overfishing](https://www.edf.org/oceans/overfishing-most-serious-threat-our-oceans)\n\n* [Pesticides and Herbicides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2984095/)\n\n* [Dam building](https://www.americanrivers.org/threats-solutions/restoring-damaged-rivers/how-dams-damage-rivers/)\n\nThreatening biodiversity risks [Human Extinction](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/03/stop-biodiversity-loss-or-we-could-face-our-own-extinction-warns-un)\n\n\nIf harming the environment and risking human extinction doesn't make your socks roll up and down, there are much more tangible impacts that can be seen from the perspective of the consumer. One of the oft repeated arguments in favor of capitalism and the profit motive is the benefit to the customer, however many innovations have directly led to active harm of the consumer in the name of profit. There are many mechanisms for this, but fostering addiction or obfuscating harmful effects of products are some of the most rampant. These include:\n\n\n* [Increasing Cigarette Addictiveness](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/chemicals-every-cigarette)\n\n* [Manufacturing Dopamine Response in Gambling](https://theconversation.com/designed-to-deceive-how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain-91052)\n\n* [Engineering Fast Food for Addiction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999689/)\n\n* [The Opioid Epidemic](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116hhrg43010/html/CHRG-116hhrg43010.htm)\n\n\nFinally, there is the impact on the labor force. Modern capitalism has grown quite adept at creating novel and innovative ways to suppress workers\u2019 rights, wages, and quality of life. Examples of these innovations include:\n\n\n* [McDonald\u2019s Threatening Automation in Response to Wage Complaints](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/former-mcdonalds-ceo-threatens-replace-employees-robots)\n\n* [Gig Economy Exploiting Workers](https://niwr.org/our-work/gig-economy/)\n\n* [Dehumanizing Workplace Surveillance Practices](https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/workplace-surveillance-is-becoming-the-new-normal-for-u-s-workers/)\n\n* [Workers Killed by Robots](https://www.sciencealert.com/volkswagen-worker-grabbed-and-killed-by-robot-in-german-plant)\u00a0\n\n\nThis is far from comprehensive, but I believe the point is clear. The argument that profit motive causes innovation, and that innovation is good, is a reductive argument. Innovation is not an ideal in and of itself, and the varieties of innovation and the motives for those innovations each lead to different outcomes benefitting different groups. The existence and prioritization of profit as the primary motive for society leads to horrifying impacts for the environment, consumers, and workers. Again, this does not discount the existence of alternative motivations for innovation within a capitalist framework, simply an indictment of profit as the primary motive, necessarily sidelining incentives that don't uniquely benefit corporations and shareholders.", "#NIOCORP- Today's ~NIOBIUM, TITANIUM , SCANDIUM & RARE EARTHS Related News March 15, 2023~ # #NIOCORP- Today's ~NIOBIUM, TITANIUM , SCANDIUM & RARE EARTHS Related News MArch 15, 2023~\n\n  \n\n# MARCH 14, 2023 ~BOEING~Riyadh Air to Launch with All-Boeing Fleet~\n\n **POSTED BY:** [**AEROMORNING2023**](https://aeromorning.com/en/author/admwebmaerom2016/)\n\n [Riyadh Air to Launch with All-Boeing Fleet - AeroMorning](https://aeromorning.com/en/riyadh-air-to-launch-with-all-boeing-fleet/) \n\n# New Saudi Arabian Carrier Riyadh Air to Launch with All-Boeing Fleet of up to 72 ~787-9 Dreamliners~\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v90kj01n5wna1.png?width=4391&format=png&auto=webp&s=059131d364e26d3bdf9a8e3635dae0784517bcfb\n\n***\u2013 Riyadh-based, PIF-owned airline to order 39 Dreamliners, with options for 33 more jets, enabling tourism and sustainable growth- Passenger-pleasing, fuel-efficient 787s will support Saudi Arabia\u2019s goal of welcoming 100 million visitors per year by 2030***\n\n***RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 14, 2023 /***[***PRNewswire***](http://www.prnewswire.com/)***/ \u2014 Boeing \\[NYSE: BA\\] and Riyadh Air announced today that the new Saudi Arabian carrier has chosen the 787 Dreamliner to power its global launch and support its goal of operating one of the most efficient and sustainable fleets in the world.***\n\n***Owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air said it will purchase 39 highly efficient 787-9s, with options for an additional 33 787-9s.

Surprisingly, many people actually didn't know where those ideas originally came from.  I can't stand to see misinformation still poisoning the discussion so long after it's been put down, so I want to take a shot at setting the record straight, without requiring people to have to dig to find the actual facts buried underneath the misinformation.\n\nThe fact is, even accounting for the battery manufacturing, transportation, and disposal/recycling, hybrids actually do have notably lower lifetime emissions than normal cars.  Most of the idea about the Prius being worse for the environment than normal cars can be traced back to two sources from 2006 and 2007 - virtually all the other sources are just echoes of those two.\n\nThe first was the Daily Mail, who claimed that Prius battery production had left Sudbury a scarred lunar landscape.  That story was [completely retracted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417227/Toyota-factory.html) when it was pointed out to them that the damage both occurred, and was cleaned up, decades before the Prius even existed.  That is also ignoring the fact that the Prius' nickel demand [accounted for just 0.5% of the mine's total output](http://www.thecarconnection.com/tips-article/1010861_prius-versus-hummer-exploding-the-myth), as well as the fact that all cars use nickel in their stainless steel components.  Based on that, it's extremely implausible that an extra 40 or so pounds of nickel for the battery will inflict so much extra environmental damage as to erase all pollution reduction gains from improved efficiency realized over the car and battery's 10+ year lifetime, especially since the vast majority of a car's pollution is incurred in operation (more on that in a bit).\n\nThe second was CNW Marketing, who infamously claimed in its \"Dust to Dust analysis\" that the Prius, over its lifetime, is worse for the environment than a Hummer.  That study [was shot to pieces](http://www.pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hummer_vs_prius3.pdf) for making biased assumptions favouring the Hummer and disfavouring the Prius (379,000 miles/35 years for the H1 Hummer vs 109,000 miles/12 years for the Prius).  The other critical error they made was assuming that the vast majority of a car's pollution is incurred in manufacturing, rather than operations.  That assumption contradicted a huge body of research from the Rocky Mountain Institute, Transport Research Ltd., the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Center for Sustainable Systems of the University of Michigan, MIT, Volkswagen, the Argonne National Laboratory, and more recently the UCLA.  All of those groups collectively indicated the reverse was true (all references except UCLA's available in the previous link; UCLA link available below).\n\nBased on the collective findings of those organizations, even accounting for the allegedly tremendous difficulties of a hybrid car's battery production and the extra electric motor, 90% of all pollution is incurred in driving the car.  The remaining 10% is split over manufacturing, transporting, and disposing of/recycling the car.  As for the exact breakdowns of pollution per phase, the UCLA did a [good paper](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media_IOE/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf) that gives more exact numbers.  The [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/378.PDF)'s aforementioned life cycle analysis is also consistent with that result.\n\nThere are also criticisms that the shipping of the Prius' individual components is what incurs enough pollution to more than cancel out its efficiency gains.  This, I believe, mostly came from [a student op-ed piece from Connecticut State University](http://www.pdegraaf.com/articles/prius.html) (itself a blend of CNW and Daily Mail's misinformation) and [repeated almost word for word by Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmxUsGiGp3w&t=3m35s). That doesn't square with the reality of shipping efficiency being the world's most efficient form of transport.  Ships move goods at an efficiency of around [600 miles per gallon, per ton](http://www.portofmonroe.com/index.php/pom/shipping-advantages), and that's being conservative, as the UCLA paper above stated 1,000 MPGPT as their assumption.  Given that a Prius weighs [3,042 pounds](http://www.toyota.com/prius/features.html#!/weights_capacities/1223/1225/1227/1229), or 1.35 tons, that means you can move a fully built Prius across the Pacific Ocean to the US (~5,500 miles) using just 12 gallons of freighter fuel.  At that scale, the transportation emissions for moving the battery pack's weight around is effectively negligible.\n\nAll this is not to say that there are no valid criticisms of hybrids - the best of them tend to be purpose-built for efficiency and practicality at the expense of the driving experience.  As well, the inferior handling and controversial styling of the Prius in particular are definitely questionable.  That said, criticisms of hybrid cars' relative environmental impact have collectively failed to stand up to scrutiny, based on all available evidence.  At this point, criticizing hybrids for being worse for the environment is just perpetuating old misinformation, which should have died a quick death half a decade ago rather than persisting as long as it has.", "Article: Boom or supercycle? Copper hitting $50,000 a tonne is no certainty but you can still make money out of commodities [https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/boom-or-supercycle/](https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/boom-or-supercycle/)\n\nTLDR: Iron ore predicted to fall from 2022 (maybe why VALE and BHP are flat!), copper to keep going up. Uranium having the most upside over the next five years. Supercycle-agnostic options include key EV materials such as nickel, lithium and cobalt. \n\nConspicuous lack of steel mention in the article \u2013 only mention is that \"Advances will also be needed to strip out at least some of the massive emissions involved in steel, aluminium and cement manufacturing.\" (wink wink CLF, MT for their 'green steel' options)\n\n\\--\n\nGrowth on top of current metals prices would see mining company earnings explode. The commodities that have hit decade-long highs or record highs in the past two years include gold, copper, iron ore, silver, palladium, rhodium, and more. An industrial boom beyond the Covid-19 recovery could push these higher. Mining investors have already had a taste of this, and **BHP** (BHP) and **Rio Tinto** (RIO) are already easily outperforming most of the FTSE 100.\n\nRio has a forward dividend yield of 10.1 per cent, BHP\u2019s is 7.6 per cent, compared with the FTSE 100 average of 3.8 per cent, and their total returns have surged already.\u00a0 \n\n  \nTo cite one of the originators of the boom idea, Goldman Sachs analyst Jeff Currie,\u00a0we\u2019re in for a structural shift in demand, which make it a supercycle. In a recent interview, Currie said this supercycle would be like what was seen in the 1970s.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a very similar set-up to what we had in the mid-1960s, that created that structural bull market, or supercycle, in the 1970s,\u201d he said in an interview with S&P Global Platts in February.\u00a0\n\nFellow star analyst Marko Kolanovic, at JP Morgan, said in February we were in the upswing phase of the supercycle after 12 years of \u201ccontraction\u201d in cycle terms. The last one ended in 2008, he said, although others say it lasted until 2014.\n\nCurrie points to three facts that are similar to our present moment: there are redistributional policies, environmental policies and \u201cversatility in supply chain initiatives\u201d driving commodities demand.\u00a0\n\nThe comparative lead-up was the 1960s, in the US, which saw the war on poverty launched by LBJ, and the war on acid rain that saw sulphur removed from petrol. The supply chain dynamics come from the Cold War, which drove the US to build up a strategic reserve of materials.\u00a0\n\nNow, the redistributional policies are the trillions in global stimulus spending, the environmental piece is the green-led pandemic recovery and existing energy transition spending and the supply chain kicker is China's hoarding of\u00a0strategic reserves. The previous supercycle in the mid-2000s was more simple. It was driven by China\u2019s rapid growth and huge levels of government spending.\u00a0\n\nFurther back, other supercycle examples are Britain\u2019s industrialisation (although over a much longer period), the US rail boom between 1871 and 1894 and Japan\u2019s post-second world war reconstruction, from 1950 to 1970. Each is identified in 'China: The Engine of a Commodities Super Cycle', a famous 2005 note by Citibank analyst Alan Heap that declared a supercycle was on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo this is about more than China ramping up electric vehicle (EV) production and apartment building; a supercycle indicates truly massive global changes. But Xi Jinping\u2019s plans for his country to aim for net zero carbon emissions by 2060 adds much credibility to the supercycle theory.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen President Xi announced the country\u2019s carbon neutrality goal...he was giving notice of the complete transformation of its economy and how it produces, transports, and consumes energy,\u201d says Wood Mackenzie research director Miaoru Huang.\u00a0\n\nThis will be a mammoth effort, given China consumes 4bn tonnes of coal a year and is the world\u2019s leader in highly-polluting steel and cement manufacturing. The new low- or no-carbon power options alone would cost $6.4tn, according to WoodMac. In the short term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees China\u2019s coal generation rising by some 180 terrawatt hours (TWh) in 2021. This will be the largest rise since 2018, when generation rose 300TWh.\u00a0\n\nOutside China, Europe\u2019s commitment to building its own EVs\u00a0and the new Biden administration\u2019s $3tn stimulus package will also drive demand for commodities. Huge amounts of metals will be needed to both build the cars and the infrastructure needed to charge them.\u00a0\n\nAt an investor level, a supercycle would bring even greater profits for miners and inflation for many other company holdings.\u00a0\n\nCurrie thinks copper could be a $50,000/t commodity, which would jack up prices for consumers. Air conditioners, fridges and other home appliances all need copper, while the average EV\u00a0has around 80kg of copper, according to the industry group the Copper Alliance.\u00a0\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t happen in a bubble, however, with a stronger US dollar cutting the real costs of higher commodity prices. Lower oil prices in the long term would also cut corporate costs globally, although it\u2019s possible oil supply will fall more sharply than demand within a few years, as financing gets tougher for projects. This is one of Currie\u2019s theories.\u00a0\n\n## The middle ground \n\nThe supercycle argument is whether the current price highs, which are driven by short-term supply and demand, will turn into record prices across the board because of the energy transition.\u00a0\n\nING head of commodities strategy Warren Patterson told *Investors\u2019 Chronicle* that\u00a0China could start slowing its spending and stop the supercycle talk in its tracks this year.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo the big question is \\[are the current prices\\] sustainable moving forward? And I think that's where it gets a little bit more interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are suggestions that we will start seeing China resuming its deleveraging campaign, I think that is something that's very likely to happen, given the fact that they wouldn't want their economy to start overheating.\u201d\u00a0\n\nChina consumes just over half of the world\u2019s commodities, so the government cutting back lending to industry would make a significant difference to prices.\u00a0\n\nA fellow sceptic is Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum. He thinks what we\u2019re seeing now is just a supercycle-esque recovery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe believe that 2020-21\u2019s broad-based commodity rally resembles those of 1984, 1991, 2001, 2009 \u2013 in terms of scale of lift from base, and occurring immediately after a global recession,\u201d he said in a March note.\n\nIn part this reflects slightly different definitions of what a supercycle constitutes (see boxout for further detail).\n\nBut Currie, Davis and Patterson agree the energy transition will have an impact on commodity prices. There is a way to sit on the fence on this question.\n\nEven if a supercycle does not occur and copper and iron ore prices fall back closer to the cost of production (as Davis forecasts), there are plenty of investment opportunities to back the energy transition, beyond just throwing money at **Tesla** (US:TSLA).\u00a0  \n\n\n## Bull-ish\n\nIf we take the view that commodity\u00a0prices will stay high enough for most investors to justify adding to their mining holdings, either through individual companies or ETFs, then it\u2019s worth working out which metals will do the best out of a continued bull market.\u00a0\n\n**Copper is the obvious choice given its transition uses, while nickel has similar appeal but is rarer among the majors. Iron ore has been strong for over two years now, above $150/t, but prices are widely expected to fall from 2022.**\u00a0\n\n**Macquarie Bank and Liberum have the metal falling below $100/t next year, which would mean big dents to Rio and BHP\u2019s profits.**\u00a0\n\nThe mining industry has long pitched copper as heading towards a supply deficit, and so existing operations would have supercharged profits further into the 2020s. Given copper\u2019s current highs, even maintaining the $9,000/t level beyond this year would be enough to confirm a bull-plus market.\n\nGlobal X ETFs' head of research Morgane Delledonne takes a view that copper is worth backing in the short term because of US infrastructure spending and supply uncertainties and as a hedge to rising inflation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe have seen in the past that copper is one of the best-performing assets when there are inflationary pressures,\u201d she says. \u201cBut beyond this near term, I'd say macro conditions of rising inflation and reflation trades, the structural changes for copper that will lead to potentially higher prices in the future are the acceleration of electrical vehicles adoption, and also the infrastructure spending.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDelledonne also underlined China\u2019s \u201cvery deep and long-term focus\u201d on building infrastructure as a driver, while some analysts say demand will drop off shortly as the market gets out of undersupply. Davis has copper on his \u201cavoid\u201d list for the next 12 months, but sees mine supply issues as driving the market in the longer term.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe expect the market to return to balance later this year, with a persistent modest surplus weighing on the medium-term price outlook,\u201d he asserts.\u00a0\n\nFor context, copper falling below $7,000/t would largely be a return to the status quo, given mines are mostly built to be profitable under $6,000/t.\n\nSome low cost producers, such as\u00a0**Central Asia Metals** (CAML), are well below that level, so even for supercycle sceptics, the sector is worth looking at. WoodMac\u2019s base case demand forecast for the next 20 years is 2 per cent growth a year. This means the world has to find an extra 9mt a year by 2040. A scenario where the world tries to hit the Paris climate goal of a maximum two-degree rise in temperature compared with 1990 would bring on growth of 3.5 per cent a year, doubling demand growth over 20 years compared with the base case.\u00a0\n\nThe largest copper mine in the world, Escondida in Chile, produces just over 1mt a year.\u00a0\n\nThe mining world has known for a long time it would start running into trouble with copper supply and demand dynamics,\u00a0but a lack of major discoveries and a weak market between 2015 and 2019 meant exploration was limited. WoodMac said investors clamouring for the \u201cdividend drug\u201d are partly to blame for this.\u00a0\n\n**Taseko Mines** (TKO) president Stuart McDonald sees the\u00a0industry continuing to move\u00a0to lower grade or harder-to-mine deposits.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen you have demand growth every year, you know, from emerging markets, from electric vehicles, from renewable energy and electrification, that all needs new copper and new mined supply,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in order to \\[find\\] that, you've got to go to lower grade deposits and sometimes you have to go to more challenging jurisdictions around the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHis company has snagged a new mine in the US, but is using a mining technique that would be more familiar to oil and gas companies, where wells are dug and the copper recovered in-situ by dissolving the rock and then pumping up the solution, which is then turned into copper cathode.\u00a0\n\nEven with the undersupply situation within a few years \u2013 as per WoodMac forecasts \u2013 London\u2019s copper miners do not have easy projects to throw a few hundred million dollars at in exchange for a 100,000t-a-year mine. Rio has shown this with its troubled Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia.\n\nThis was hailed as a major new discovery 20 years ago, which was true, but getting it right is proving tough and expensive.\n\nThe difficult of building a mine has even been used to justify delisting **Kaz Minerals** (KAZ). The chairman, Oleg Novachuk, believes investors will not stomach the $8bn price tag and years of development needed to get the massive Baimskaya mine up and running. The pushback from shareholders has proved this narrative is not so clear-cut, however.\u00a0\n\nSubstitution is not feasible currently because of aluminium\u2019s poor conduction and greater risk in electric systems, so copper will remain critical.\n\nLondon\u2019s copper producers all offer something different. **Antofagasta** (ANTO) for large-scale production, **Atalaya Mining** (ATYM) for a smaller European option, **Central Asia Metals** for its low cost and consistent dividends.\u00a0\n\n## What else?\u00a0\n\nThe symbol of the previous mining boom was iron ore. Houses in Perth and in the Pilbara, home to the metal\u2019s most profitable and prodigious supplies, became some of the priciest in the world from the mid-2000s, while the cost of a coffee in Western Australia could shock even those used to sipping espressos in Mayfair.\u00a0\n\nIron ore got near the $200/t mark in 2011, but new supply came on and prices dropped. This is the usual cycle.\n\nDavis at Liberum said iron ore would likely be subject to these usual pressures, given the mining industry\u2019s ability to expand supply and the likely recovery in Chinese scrap supply.\u00a0\n\nThere are a few more interesting options than iron ore anyway, in terms of supercycle-ready investments.\u00a0\n\nDelledonne at Global X has picked uranium as a winner despite questions over its green credentials.\u00a0She sees it as a low-carbon option ready to be rolled out. \u201c\\[Nuclear\\] has large-scale potential for energy output, but also the cost is aligned with traditional fuel energy production cost like few of your stations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe do think there is a lot of opportunity in the nuclear space, and the bad reputation of nuclear power since what happened in Fukushima is abating with time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSupercycle-agnostic options include key EV materials such as nickel, lithium and cobalt. Manganese also got a boost in March as Volkswagen outlined its massive EV ramp up.\n\nA much more counterintuitive pick for an energy transition winner is oil. Currie said a supercycle in which the dollar and bulk commodities push much higher could see oil back over $100 a barrel (bbl). As investors have seen in recent months, oil and gas companies have done well as demand recovers. This has been helped along by Opec and Russia cutting supply, which could swiftly come back on alongside a mooted recovery in air travel, for example.\n\nPatterson at ING is more circumspect, at least in the short term, believing US production can respond to higher prices now compared with when oil was last at $100/bbl and Opec could quickly increase supply. Davis has oil flat on a five-year basis, but sees uranium as having the most upside over the next five years.\n\n## Oh yeah, climate change\n\nPlunging into commodity research often leaves you stuck looking at individual trees. The woods in this scenario are climate change, and the reason the energy transition has to happen.\n\nInvesting in oil might be smart if you follow Currie\u2019s thinking \u2013 just remember the Opec risk \u2013 but many investors have already shifted away from this sector for ethical reasons.\n\nSimilarly, building new mines all over the world would be a strange solution to the problem.\n\nThe holy grail here might be low-carbon copper or even a recycling option. EV ingredients will also change, and recycling was a key part of Volkswagen\u2019s \u2018Power Day\u2019 presentation this month. Advances will also be needed to strip out at least some of the massive emissions involved in steel, aluminium and cement manufacturing.\n\nSupercycle or not, we\u2019re in for a thrilling ride in the next decade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is a supercycle?**\n\nMost industries are cyclical. In mining and oil and gas this is a bit more obvious, given companies sell products that change in price daily. A bull market is driven by high demand and inadequate supply. This usually turns into a bust drop because the higher price brings on new supply or demand falls.\n\nA supercycle is driven by structural changes, where demand will be transformed. Think oil and the widespread introduction of passenger cars.\n\nThe most recent of these changes has been China, a development notably called by Citibank's Alan Heap near the start of\u00a0the early 2000s boom, who defined a supercycle as\u00a0\u201ca prolonged (decades) trend rise in real commodity prices, driven by the urbanisation and industrialisation of a major economy\u201d.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really sound like we can call this now.\n\nBut Heap also says \u201chigh and rising intensity of metals use is the most useful indicator of a supercycle\u201d.\u00a0That sounds closer to our present macro environment, especially in the case of copper.", "ALLS15A Brainless sponges have cells that might be the precursors of neurons\n\nSponges are arguably the simplest animals and they lack a nervous system, but peculiar cells in their digestive chambers may be evolutionary precursors of neurons\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2296329-brainless-sponges-have-cells-that-might-be-the-precursors-of-neurons/\n\nIt calculated the cost to build transmission between now and 2035, with a few scenarios of how that might unfold.

But this conference has become an enormous sponsorship opportunity for big companies, allowing them to get in front of thousands of people debating the future of the planet.

The findings suggest that male physicians hold biases that disadvantage female surgeons, further widening the gender pay gap in medicine.\n\nResearchers at Unity Health Toronto and ICES compared the proportion of referrals made by male and female physicians to male and female surgeons over a ten year span from 1997 to 2016. Nearly 40 million referrals were made to 5,660 surgeons. Although male surgeons accounted for 77.5 per cent of all surgeons, they received 79 per cent of referrals sent by female physicians, but 87 per cent of referrals sent by male physicians.\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/934220\n\nThe team created maps of global temperature changes for every 200-year interval going back 24,000 years.\n\n\"These maps are really powerful,\" Osman said. \"With them, it's possible for anyone to explore how temperatures have changed across Earth, on a very personal level.

They focus on what will be done by the end of the decade, by which time global greenhouse gas emissions must be roughly half what they were in 2010 in order to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. So far, no country is on track to do this, says Niklas H\u00f6hne of NewClimate Institute, a think-tank. Dr H\u00f6hne is part of a consortium of researchers called Climate Action Tracker, which plugs national climate policies and pledges into models in order to give an idea of how they translate into temperatures. The group\u2019s latest results (see chart), published on November 9th, say that if all 2030 decarbonisation plans were to be carried out as advertised but no further efforts were made, there would be a 68% chance that global average temperatures in 2100 would be between 1.9\u00b0C and 3.0\u00b0C warmer than pre-industrial times, with a median estimate of 2.4\u00b0C.\nhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/11/13/are-climate-goals-set-in-2015-dead-or-alive\n\nUp until exposure to 95 decibels of sound, the inner ear fluid level remained normal. However, researchers discovered that after exposure to 100 decibels\u2014which is equivalent to sounds such as a power lawn mower, chain saw or motorcycle\u2014mice developed inner ear fluid buildup within hours. A week after this exposure, the animals were found to have lost auditory nerve cells.\n\nHowever, when researchers applied hypertonic saline, a salt-based solution used to treat nasal congestions in humans, into affected ears one hour after the noise exposure, both the immediate fluid buildup and the long-term nerve damage lessened, implying that the hearing loss could be at least partially prevented.\n\nThese study results have several important implications, according to Oghalai, especially as the loss of nerve cells in the inner ear is known as \"hidden hearing loss\" because hearing tests are unable to detect the damage.\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-loud-noises-fluid-buildup-ear.html\n\nCompared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna\u2019s shot has led to only 10 additional cases of myocarditis per 100,000 inoculations among males age 12 to 29, Burton said.

The Department of the Interior will offer up more than 80 million acres \u2014 an area larger than the state of New Mexico \u2014 of the Gulf of Mexico for drilling. It is bigger than any lease sale conducted under President Donald Trump\u2019s fossil-fuel-friendly administration, and Interior estimates it will lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades.\n\nThe administration argues its hands are tied, following the June decision by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana to strike down Biden\u2019s executive order temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters.\n\n\u201cThe administration has made clear that it disagrees with the ruling and the Department of Justice has appealed it, but the government must comply with it in the meantime,\u201d White House spokesman Vedant Patel said in an email statement, noting that Interior previously canceled the pending lease sale.\n\nThe injunction stemmed from a lawsuit brought by 14 Republican attorneys against the administration.

For this reason, some of the best actions in Europe are going to be found in this country.\n\nThe best German stocks are not found in one sector exclusively, although it is true that sectors such as manufacturing are of key importance to its economy. The automobile industry, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry of the financial sector are an important part of the German economy.\n\nGermany is a country with great export potential, it is the third exporting country only behind China and the United States in terms of industrial production.\n\nThe German trade surplus remains in permanent competition with China.

It is one of the best-known European financial institutions globally. Despite its German origin, this financial entity had a clear international vocation, and has a strong global presence.\n\nIt is important to appreciate when thinking about Deutsche Bank securities that it is a company that found itself at the epicenter of the European sovereign debt crisis. The entity was one of the main MF Global creditors with what this entailed. During the last five years, except for small upward periods, the securities of this financial entity have been gradually declining in value.\n\nDeutsche Bank represent the securities of a global financial entity of banking and financial shares that is headquartered in Frankfurt, but has a strong international presence.\n\nDeutsche Bank was one of the main players in the European sovereign debt crisis, very close to the epicenter of the crisis, being one of the main creditors of MF Global at the time.

However, everything will depend on how we get out of the crisis. \n\nIn general, all companies in the automotive sector see 2020 as a lost year due to the impact on sales that the general state of alarm has caused. It remains to be seen how they recover for the next few years.

Indeed, the PM has laid out his belief, in which he has been joined by the leader of the opposition, that the economic sustainability of India's economy is vital not just for its own survival, but the survival of the world.  \n\nIndia is not just interested in its own path, but in fostering connections between a great many companies, countries, NGOs, individuals and so on.  To that end the Indian government will be inviting representatives to a major 'Green Buisness Expo', that it now hopes to hold every two years in India, and will hope that leading lights in the world will attend to network.  \n\nThis expo, to be called 'GreenEx' will be held next May in New Delhi.\n\nIndia will be inviting representatives from major 'tech economies' which may be interested in selling to India or, better yet, be interested in putting their products into mass manufacture in India:\n\n* Japan - An Invitation will be extended to several Japanese firms.  Fujitsu for example, alongside car manufacturers Toyota, Suzuki and Nissan who produce hybrid and electric vehicles.  \n\n* Germany - Firms such as Siemens, BMW and Volkswagen will be invited.  \n\n* France - French firms such as EDF will be invited to the Expo to showcase their technology, while french auto company Renault will be invited to display it's electric vehicle technology.\n\n* USA - From the USA of course many firms will be invited, but the event organisers are most keen of all to see Boeing, General Electric and, if possible, Tesla flaunt their wares at the expo.\n\nIn addition business leaders in India are to be invited, community leaders too, and some of the leading academics of the world, from environmental scientists to demographers to experts in town planning.  ", "Inside James Dyson\u2019s Costly Decision to Kill His Electric Car **James Dyson,** the billionaire British inventor and entrepreneur, is standing on a small stage at the mid-September gala opening of his new flagship retail store in Paris. The space is more high-end art gallery than appliance mart: matte black walls and ceiling, gray tile floors, and stylish gadgets displayed like sculptures, spotlighted on white-topped plinths.\u00a0\n\nDyson, spry and lanky at 72 years old, is wearing owlish blue-frame glasses and a copper-toned, thigh-length jacket evocative of a mad scientist\u2019s lab coat. In his cut-glass English accent he\u2019s running through his company\u2019s latest wares: a hair dryer that uses circular airflow to avoid heat damage; a hair styler that wraps curls using a vortex of air; a bladeless oval air purifier that blows hot and cold; a combination water faucet and hand dryer. The list goes on, ending, inevitably, with a cordless vacuum cleaner, the category consumers most closely associate with Dyson\u2019s name.\u00a0\n\nFor all the eye-catching design and technological wonder of Dyson\u2019s body of work, many in the audience are hoping he\u2019ll make a pronouncement about the one much-discussed Dyson product that\u2019s not yet for sale. Then the great man utters the words they\u2019ve longed to hear: \u201cthe car.\u201d He flicks to an aerial photograph, not of an automobile, but of the former Royal Air Force base in rural England where his team has been working in great secrecy to design an electric vehicle. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I\u2019ll say about the car this evening,\u201d he declares. True to his word, he pivots to rhapsodizing about an LED lamp designed by his 47-year-old son and heir apparent, Jake.\n\nWithin weeks, the reason behind Dyson\u2019s reticence becomes clear: He had already decided the car project was doomed. In fact, while he was exuberantly peddling vacuums and hair stylers, his bankers were unsuccessfully scrambling to find a buyer for the electric vehicle program to which Dyson had committed four years, hundreds of engineers, and 2\u00a0billion pounds ($2.5 billion). On Oct.\u00a010, Dyson said his privately held company would cease work on the project, ending his electric car dreams before the first model ever rolled off the assembly line.\u00a0\n\nBUNKER MENTALITY: Reminders of World War II, like this hangar, remain at the former air base, where Dyson prototyped its doomed car.COURTESY OF DYSONIt was a gutsy decision and a rare public setback for Dyson, who, with his family, owns the entirety of the company that bears his name. He had put his estimable reputation on the line with the car, promising a \u201cradically different\u201d vehicle that would feature \u201crevolutionary\u201d battery technology while outperforming more experienced competitors. And he had promised to have it in customers\u2019 hands by 2021, a dramatically short time frame for a neophyte automaker. In the end, a chagrined Dyson says the decision came down to a simple business proposition. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t commercially viable,\u201d he said, in an exclusive interview with _Fortune_the day after news broke of the car\u2019s demise. Although Dyson\u2019s crack auto team successfully created an innovative new car, he wasn\u2019t willing to price it below cost, as he believes the competition is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, really, because our engineers have done a brilliant job.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDyson\u2019s inability to produce a profitable automobile speaks volumes about the current perilous state of the electric vehicle industry, in which companies like Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and Chinese startup Nio are burning through billions of dollars annually with no sign of black ink on the horizon. The story of his audacious but ultimately failed project also says much about Dyson, the rare executive who can combine blue-sky dreaming with steely-eyed financial discipline. At a time when every company speaks about innovation and disruption, Dyson\u2019s decision to kill his electric car is a case study in the delicate balancing act of embracing ingenuity while keeping an eye on profits.\u00a0\n\n********\n\n**Improbable** though it seems in retrospect, there were good reasons for James Dyson to attempt to make an all-electric automobile. Electrification presented a once-in-a-century opportunity in the auto industry, one that Dyson was not alone in spotting. Electric powertrains require only about 20 moving parts compared with more than 2,000 for cars with internal\u00a0combustion engines\u2014a fact that theoretically lowers barriers to entry. What\u2019s more, Tesla had caught the global automotive industry sleeping on EVs, and several years ago, it looked as if there was room for more entrants. [Apple](/fortune500/apple/) was rumored to be working on a car, for example, as was [Google](/fortune500/alphabet/). \u201cAnybody can build an electric car,\u201d veteran automotive analyst Maryann Keller says. \u201cIt\u2019s an open playing field.\u201d\n\nDyson thought he had a better shot than most. His company was thriving, with 2018 sales jumping 25% to a record $5.6\u00a0billion. Pretax operating profits topped $1\u00a0billion for the first time, driven by strong demand in Asia, where Dyson is a status-conferring consumer brand. Through its vacuums, Dyson\u2019s company already was a global leader in electric motors. It knew batteries too, thanks to its cordless products. Key EV concepts like airflow and climate control also were present in all of Dyson\u2019s appliances. \u201cWhen we realized, almost by accident, that we had the technology to build an electric car, it was natural to go into it,\u201d Dyson says. Back in 2015, when he first conceived of it, Dyson says there seemed to be ample room in the market for a chassis-to-moonroof rethink of what an EV should be. \u201cYou have to remember that four or five years ago, only Tesla was on the scene,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it was a very different sort of environment.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe inventor had made a career of proving skeptics wrong. He\u2019d successfully reimagined one mundane household product after another, starting with an innovative wheelbarrow in 1974. He\u2019d made his name and fortune with the bagless vacuum cleaner, which used a \u201ccyclone\u201d effect to draw dust out of the air. Launched in 1993, the vacuums featured a transparent bin that let you see exactly how much dust you\u2019d sucked up. (He famously overruled marketing experts who told him no one would buy a vacuum that showcased the dirt.) New models included advancements such as ball-like handle attachments for maneuvering into tight corners. Slim cordless uprights were made possible by the company\u2019s electric motor research. Dyson was also adept at extending his expertise into new categories, like the Airblade hand dryer as well as bladeless fans and air purifiers.\u00a0\n\nWhile a car may have looked like a leap, \u00adDyson had been building up to designing one for years, in part because of a hankering to invent a solution for the pollution-spewing internal combustion engine. Affronted by the smell and smoke from diesel engines, in the late 1980s and early 1990s he developed a filter for the particulate belched by trucks, based on technology used in his bagless vacuum. But trucking companies refused to buy it, he says, because they didn\u2019t want to have to empty the filter. He also blames U.K. and European regulators who insisted that diesel was \u201cgreen and clean,\u201d despite abundant scientific evidence of ill-health effects. \u201cThere was a sort of jilted feeling,\u201d he says, acknowledging his search for new technology \u201chas been lurking\u201d ever since. Grand projects have been started for shakier reasons.\u00a0\n\n********\n\nJames Dyson\n-----------\n\n**At 72, the British inventor\u00a0has been innovating his whole adult life. His contraptions span from gardening to hair styling.**\n\n### Inventor\n\nDyson\u2019s first hit came in 1974, a redesigned wheelbarrow that replaced the typical narrow rubber wheel with a plastic sphere that resisted sinking into muddy ground. He called it the \u00adBallbarrow.\n\nDyson then turned his attention to the bagless vacuum. It took a decade and 5,127 prototypes to perfect his design for the product that ultimately would make his name and fortune.\u00a0\n\n### Environmentalist\n\nDyson has been worked up about pollution for decades, but not out of concern for global warming. He loathed the exhaust spewed into the air by diesel-burning engines popular in Europe. \u201cI hated the smell,\u201d he says. \u201cI hated the black smoke.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe developed a filter to capture diesel particulates but couldn\u2019t persuade trucking companies to buy it. His dislike of fossil-fuel burning engines persisted.\n\n### Landowner, philanthropist, patriot\n\nAside from his day job, Dyson runs a profitable agriculture business. He owns more farmland than anyone else in the U.K., including Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHis James Dyson Foundation runs an annual award program in 27 countries, in search of the most innovative inventions. To train more U.K. engineers, he founded the James Dyson Institute, which offers undergraduates free engineering degrees and work experience.\n\nHe also likes to display the work of other British inventors on the grounds of his company\u2019s corporate campus in rural Wiltshire, 100 miles west of London. A Brexit supporter, Dyson had critics who chafed at his plans to relocate HQ to Singapore.\u00a0\n\n### Secret Keeper\n\nDyson is a 14,000-person company whose paranoia for protecting corporate secrets, dating back to piracy of the Ballbarrow\u2019s design, rivals Apple\u2019s. It is an active litigant on its patent portfolio, having tussled with the likes of Hoover and Samsung.Employees generally operate on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis and are expected not to discuss projects outside their teams, including in communal cafeterias.\n\n********\n\n**Work on** the top-secret car program began in earnest in 2015, as Dyson recruited auto industry veterans from Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover. The company is accustomed to operating clandestinely. Bitter experience from Dyson\u2019s earliest days as an inventor, when he says a competitor pinched his wheelbarrow design, taught the entrepreneur to be paranoid. Products inside the company are known only by a number until they are publicly unveiled. (An early version of the doomed car was called \u201cN526.\u201d) Fingerprint scanners control access to labs.\u00a0\n\nBut this time the secret got out. The U.K. government accidentally revealed Dyson\u2019s work on an electric car in an industrial strategy report it published online. That, and the increasing scale of the endeavor\u2014which included a 200-million-pound refurbishment of the old RAF airfield to serve as the design and testing hub for the car and the hiring of hundreds of people\u2014forced Dyson to come clean. In September 2017, he held a press conference in London to officially announce the project, saying he was committing 2\u00a0billion pounds to the endeavor, including 1\u00a0billion aimed at producing a breakthrough in battery technology.\u00a0\n\nAutomotive experts thought the sum was paltry compared with what would be needed to build a car. But it was orders of magnitude bigger than anything Dyson had ever spent on a new product. Its Supersonic hair dryer, for instance, which it launched in 2016, had taken four years and cost $71\u00a0million to develop. Many also doubted Dyson\u2019s premise that its technical know-how would transfer to electric cars. \u201cAn electric vehicle is not just a big hair dryer,\u201d says George Crabtree, director of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Joint Center for Energy Storage Research at the Argonne National Laboratory.\u00a0\n\nDyson was undeterred. The company was committed to rethinking the car from first principles\u2014a philosophy that had underpinned Dyson\u2019s success in household products. \u201cWe wanted to change everything and not use other people\u2019s architectural layout,\u201d Dyson says. The company would design all its components in-house, from motors to windshield wipers. \u201cIf you look at the way other auto companies operate, they treat components as black boxes,\u201d says Andrew Clothier, Dyson\u2019s director of technical research. They buy parts off the shelf and bolt them together. That\u2019s cheaper and faster but comes at the expense of innovation, he says. Dyson would try a completely different approach. (Tesla also designs its own electric motors, battery packs, and chargers.)\n\nThe car Dyson\u2019s team came up with was about the size of a Range Rover but with a longer wheelbase; a lower roofline; and a short, stubbed nose leading to a dramatically sloped windscreen, according to patent filings made public in May. Dyson says now the long wheelbase was necessary to accommodate a very large battery pack that would have given the car more range than any EV currently on the market. The tires were taller and narrower than usual too. That reduced rolling resistance as well as accommodating more interior space and, by allowing for lower tire pressure, provided a more comfortable ride. \u201cWe were after aerodynamic efficiency, rolling resistance efficiency, electric motor efficiency, and battery efficiency,\u201d Dyson says.\n\nEvery EV on the road today uses \u201cwet\u201d \u00adlithium-ion batteries, in which a cathode made of lithium mixed with other metals (usually nickel, manganese, and cobalt) is separated from a graphite anode by an electrolyte solution. These cells are efficient but take time to charge and are prone to catching fire. Dyson thought he could gain an edge by using solid-state batteries instead. Such batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte with a ceramic material and use a pure lithium metal anode, are the Holy Grail for EVs. They pack more power for their weight, meaning they would vastly extend the car\u2019s range. They also charge far faster and are much safer.\u00a0\n\nLast year, Dyson selected Singapore as the site for his future EV factory. The company already made its other products in neighboring Malaysia, and it saw the region as a key potential market for the car. Then, earlier this year, Dyson announced it would shift its global corporate headquarters to Singapore too. The founder bought a $54 million penthouse apartment in the city-state. Tabloids leveled accusations of betrayal at the entrepreneur, who had called for a revival of British industrial prowess and is a prominent proponent of Brexit, the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Dyson notes he continues to employ 5,000 people in the U.K.\u00a0\n\n********\n\n**All along,** James Dyson knew this project was likely to be harder than any he\u2019d attempted previously. And that was before automakers like [General Motors](https://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors/), Volkswagen, and others committed wholeheartedly to EVs. He knew that he\u2019d have to spend a lot of money and that without a dealer network, he would have to rely on direct sales through digital channels, much like Tesla, and find a way to support and service the cars in the aftermarket. But he was unprepared for just how tough the task would prove to be.\u00a0\n\nMost daunting was the competition. European and Chinese regulatory moves to ban gas engines in coming decades acted as a catalyst for major automakers. Together, they are expected to pump $300\u00a0billion into electric car development in the next decade. Suddenly, Dyson\u2019s team faced a financial reckoning just as it was time to begin installing manufacturing equipment in Singapore. \u201cDoing everything from scratch probably put up the cost,\u201d Dyson reflects. He also says that because the company could not guarantee high volumes, it could not strike the best deals with suppliers, as it had throughout decades of building appliances. And, without revealing any details, he admits the battery that the company wanted to use was more expensive than industry standards.\n\nDyson always knew his car wouldn\u2019t be cheap. He had previously joked to reporters that it might be more appropriate to talk about the size of the down payment required to buy one rather than the sticker price. But there\u2019s expensive, and then there\u2019s exorbitant. If his EV were to turn a profit, it would have to enter the market \u201cright at the top end,\u201d Dyson says. While he declines to reveal the price the company was considering, the Tesla Model X starts at about $104,000, and Faraday Future, a Chinese-backed startup in California, is planning to launch an ultraluxury SUV that may cost as much as $180,000. \u201cIt\u2019s a price where we could sell some but not enough,\u201d Dyson says.\n\nA NOT-SO-SIMPLE PLAN: Patent applications hint at what a Dyson car might have looked like.Courtesy of DysonAt the end of the day, Dyson didn\u2019t blink at the \u201csunk costs\u201d of capital already invested in the car project. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the investment at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d already committed that.\u201d Fiscally conservative, Dyson says he would never consider putting his company in financial jeopardy for the sake of his car. At the end of 2018, Dyson\u2019s debt was a manageable 368\u202fmillion pounds ($492 million), most of it long term. He refused to overleverage Dyson or take it public, which would dilute his control. \u201cWe don\u2019t have endless shareholders\u2019 money or the potential to raise shareholders\u2019 money,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a family business.\u201d\n\nDyson says he focused on \u201cthe BAM\u201d\u2014the build and materials cost\u2014of the car and therefore where he\u2019d have to price it to earn an acceptable margin. What worried Dyson wasn\u2019t the billions competitors were investing in EVs; it was their willingness to sell cars at a loss. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst who tracks the EV sector for the consulting firm Navigant, says the break-even price for a generic electric car is about $80,000. Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar all have electric luxury SUVs entering the market this year with a starting price of around $70,000. And Tesla and Nio are selling mass-market electric cars at half that price. (Tesla\u2019s burn rate hit an annual pace of $3.5\u00a0billion in 2018\u2014more than Dyson had pledged to its entire EV project.) Dyson feared his EV would look even pricier in comparison.\u00a0\n\nOnce before, Dyson had faced a similar dilemma. In November 2000, the company unveiled a washing machine called the Contrarotator. The ingenious design had two drums that spun in opposite directions. But, as with the car, Dyson says, the company\u2019s novel design and low volumes gave it little leverage with suppliers. \u201cI worked out it cost at least two-and-half times more to make than a conventional washing machine,\u201d he says. Ultimately, Dyson sold the washers for about 1,000 pounds ($1,500 at the time), at least 30% more than competitors\u2019, and even then it lost money on every one. Eventually, in 2005, the company decided to discontinue it. Dyson vowed never to sell a product below cost again.\n\nBefore deciding to abandon the car, Dyson hired bankers to try to sell the division. They approached \u201call the people you might imagine,\u201d says Dyson. (The _Financial Times_reported Jaguar Land Rover was among them.) No one bit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really get close to anyone,\u201d he says. In late September, Dyson made the fateful decision to pull the plug.\u00a0\n\nKilling fledgling products actually isn\u2019t that unusual for Dyson. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d says Stephen Courtney, Dyson\u2019s concept director. \u201cBut it is sort of the nature of working in research.\u201d Normally, the buttoned-up company fails privately and quietly. With the EV, competitors, gearheads, battery experts, and business journalists were scrutinizing its every move. \u201cIt was the hardest decision we\u2019ve ever had to make,\u201d says Dyson. \u201cSo many designers and engineers have put so much effort into it, and it hadn\u2019t seen the light of day.\u201d The company plans to find roles elsewhere for as many as possible of the 523 employees who worked on the car. But there won\u2019t be room for all of them.\u00a0\n\nALL IMAGES COURTESY OF DYSON\n********\n\n**Dyson\u2019s 67-acre** corporate campus in Malmesbury, about 100 miles west of London, is sprinkled with iconic examples of ingenious industrial design, among them an original Alec Issigonis\u2013designed Mini Cooper, bisected to show off its clever use of interior space; a Honda Super Cub motorcycle; and two British fighter jets. One day a prototype of Dyson\u2019s electric car may join them. In the meantime, there are already hints that the company\u2019s automotive efforts won\u2019t be wasted.\u00a0\n\nIn a windowless industrial shed being constructed behind Dyson\u2019s striking mirrored-glass D9 research lab, the company has built the largest advanced prototyping lab for solid-state batteries in Europe. Beyond EVs, solid-state batteries have potential uses in everything from mobile phones to consumer electronics to aircraft. And Dyson says it will continue its investment in them. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got something that is groundbreaking and revolutionary,\u201d says Mike Rendall, Dyson\u2019s head of energy storage industrialization. Called D9A, the new battery prototyping facility should enable Dyson \u201cto bring solid-state batteries to market as soon as possible,\u201d Rendall says.\n\nThe company is also investing heavily in robotics with uses beyond automobiles. Inside a section of the secretive D9 building, a team of 65 robotics researchers are working on machinery, much of it hidden under tarps for a journalist\u2019s visit. It is clear from what little is visible\u2014like the big brown armchair, curiously perched on a table, upon which sits something big under a sheet\u2014that it is not simply an evolution of its existing robot vacuum cleaner, the Dyson\u2019s 360 Eye. Dyson\u2019s director of robotics research, Vincent Clerc, previously led SoftBank\u2019s design of its humanoid robots \u00adPepper and Romeo. Is Dyson developing a fully humanoid robot butler or maid? Clerc won\u2019t say, although he allows that the company is focused on getting robots to perceive the world in three\u00a0dimensions.\u00a0\n\nThe day after canceling the car, Dyson seems subdued but philosophical. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of exciting stuff,\u201d he says of his product pipeline, including gadgets that may benefit from the automotive research. \u201cAnd the silver lining of this horrible decision is we can concentrate on those.\u201d Dyson may have missed his chance to beat rival billionaire Elon Musk. But the inventor seems eager to get back to the lab and put his name on yet another breakthrough product.\u2002\n\n_A version of this article appears in the November 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cJames Dyson\u2019s Electric Shock.\u201d_### More must-read stories from _Fortune_:\n\n\u2014Trump\u2019s tariffs were supposed to ding China, but [the U.S. economy is getting hit 2.5x harder\n   \n](https://fortune.com/2019/10/08/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-us-economy-impact/)\u2014Inside JP Morgan, [moving on from WeWork](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/jpmorgan-wework-adam-neumann-ipo/) is proving to be a messy proposition\n   \n \u20145 beermakers to watch from [2019\u2019s Great American Beer Festival\n   \n](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/up-and-coming-beer-brewers-gabf-2019/)\u2014A [key change to mortgage lending rules](https://fortune.com/2019/08/14/mortgage-lending-rule-change/) is coming in 2021.

Introduction\n\nOn **May 3rd, 2024** (Friday) I revealed in the evening that there was a long term chart breakout: \\[[Have a Great Weekend. Cheers Everybody! : (r/Superstonk)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cjjl8j/g_m_e_have_a_great_weekend_cheers_everybody/)\\]\n\nOn **May 6th, 2024** (Monday) I then publicized in the evening that there were indications that *'MOASS' is now beginning*:\n\n[The 7 investing days after this post saw a 490.50&#37; growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price ](https://preview.redd.it/69g2a2qovt5d1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba0ee15484d31038fdf9a87a1259b596a4680b70)\n\nOn **May 9th, 2024** (Thursday) I then reminded investors that GameStop Corp's [Price is still substantially discounted \\[(r/Superstonk)\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1co8aln/g_m_e_price_is_still_substantially_discounted/).  The 3 investing days after this post saw a 444.20% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price.\n\nOn **May 18th, 2024** (Saturday) I wrote that GameStop Corp is a [Green, Cash-and-Criminal-Siphoning, Tornado-Spawning, Category 6 Hurricane of Our Evolving Stock Market : \\[(r/Superstonk)\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cvc2af/g_m_e_the_green_cashandcriminalsiphoning/).  This was and is based on GameStop Corp rapidly raising Billions upon Billions of dollars through offerings during outsized demand phases for the stock.  This writeup continues to be a good explanation of what is happening.\n\nOn **May 31st, 2024** (Friday), after the 45 Million share offering gave GameStop Corp another Billion dollars, I wrote that there was [Evidence that 'MOASS' would resume : \\[r/Superstonk\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d549fg/g_m_e_evidence_suggests_that_moass_will_now_resume/).  The following investing day saw 205.27% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price..\n\nOn **June 4th, 2024** (Tuesday), in the evening I provided a brief technical update regarding the status a clear continuation: [MOASS - Update 1 of 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8cj2c/g_m_e_moass_update_1_of_3/).  After that post, there was a 254.82% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price.\n\nGameStop Corp is, as was prophesized, revealing institutional-driven market fraud almost daily now.  This is actively exposing white collar crime on Wall Street, and pretty easily, to the FBI's ongoing securities fraud strike force.  GameStop Corp too is siphoning cash at a pace that has never been seen before.  Now it is estimated that GameStop Corp already has over $4 Billion dollars in cash, yet the share price continues to go up!\n\n# 2. Technicals and Developments\n\nToday revealed ironclad evidence that the psychological number of $25 (*$100 prior to the 4:1 split that was once-supposed to be in the form of a dividend*) is now serving as a strong support.  This number is important, because it serves as either support or resistance.  $25 is now supported.  This means that today saw a 'backtest' off of that support.  Now, it would be reasonably expected \\[*technically*\\] for the price to bounce up off of it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rcfkht737u5d1.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb11c82c4941c8bd04cddbb82791d46263faf85a\n\nThere too are upcoming calendar events that will have an impact the ability to obtain true economic price discovery:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7t1tlp17u5d1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=269c9b3db778450295124a46b8cd57c384ac91a0\n\nThe long term chart shows that the price has clearly begun a substantial, long-term breakout that is showing no signs of slowing down (*below the '$80.00 thus far label' you can see the bottom supported trend is rising substantially*)\n\n[I anticipate that eventually, the $100-$120 price window will serve as a future support](https://preview.redd.it/sf288e2z6u5d1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=366f7a36bdd218cd374d294e55c72d1551d37411)\n\n# 3. Macro Market\n\nCitadel *et al* had continued to pump their short-term Artificial-Intelligence scam (*now sounds old, doesn't it?*) play: \"\"Nvidia\"\".  Yet, Nvidia's split today was well-considered to be the 'sell the news' event.  Therefore, and now with the Dept. of Justice beginning [a new DOJ investigation into Nvidia](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/is-doj-inquiry-into-nvidia-a-sign-the-chipmaker-has-peaked), SHF will now begin to have a shrinking equities column.  Remember that to fight against margin pressures \\[*rising liabilities columns (i.e. GameStop short bags)*\\], SHF needed to pump their equities columns \\[*i.e. shitcoins, Bitcoin, and the magnificent 7 promotion scam which includes the Nvidia pump*\\].\n\nBitcoin, and especially the altcoins that SHF attempted to pump using leverage and futures are too losing steam.  [Media outlets are now promoting a worse-than-2008 stock market crash](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles) that will now occur at any moment.  It appears, then, that SHF is attempting to 'get ahead of the Minsky moment narrative' by *front-falsifying* *the reason* why the market will go down soon.  The same front-falsifying \\['''*HoUsInG and MoRtGaGe BaCkEd SeCuRiTiEs'''*\\] occurred after the June 2008 \\[*negative-beta driven*\\] inversion that was caused by naked short sellers' irresponsible bets against Volkswagen in 2008:\n\n[GameStop FTD's from late 2020 to January 2021 stacked similarly to Volkswagen's in 2008.  Not shown in the chart is the next 'FTD train' that overwhelmed naked short sellers who exploit SEC's Reg SHO Rule 204.  35 days to the right of this chart, Volkwagen stock ran up about 1,000&#37;, and the entire stock market went down on negative beta.  This same phenomenon is occurring now again with GameStop, with the next FTD train set to be bought back in mid-June.](https://preview.redd.it/2am07qiseu5d1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=29bac599f1817fa5db276f3d89d8ed10094565a0)\n\n[This chart shows that SHF's irresponsible bets too led to a market inversion in 2008, and that the market-wide inversion was more due to this phenomenon than what was widely depicted as a housing-only problem.  Naked Short sellers got caught with overwhelmed FTDs, it caused a $100 Billion+ market shock, and hedge funds then lied about the acute cause of the 2008 crash.](https://preview.redd.it/9h5av871lu5d1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c8db5d311a663f2340651f61ff89db59591531f)\n\nYet, we already knew here in the one and only SuperStonk that the market will only go down on Negative Beta with GameStop Corp.  This will be due to hedge funds and their prime brokers who bet *so-irresponsibly,* using teacher's pensions and Americans' retirement accounts, against household investors and innocent American companies.  Irresponsible Hedge Funds like Citadel (*and especially its market-making arm*) are to blame for the coming mess on Wall Street.  This mess is going to be necessary to better-identify the fraud that these sickos engaged in - and hedge fund managers who made or supported the bad bets should be *thrown in jail* due to their premeditated violations of their fiduciary duties.\n\nIt is sad to observe and sad to admit: these hedge fund bad actors and their bought-media puppets have truly surpassed Bernie Madoff in magnitude of historical fraud.\n\nAs for me... and remaining unbiased given the above technicals... I just do not see a better place in the world for any investor to park their money right now: amidst a high-inflationary \ud83d\udcc8, high-debt \ud83e\udde8 global environment \\[an*d where two conventional warfare fronts \ud83d\udd2b remain ongoing\\]: Ga*m***eStop Corp ha***s negligible/no debt.  Gam**eStop Corp is** n*ow annually-profitable \ud83d\ude4c.  Ga*me***Stop Corp has*** *now decades-worth of cash \ud83d\udcb5.  Gam*eStop Corp too is *a fantastic, family-and-kid-friendly inve*stable brand \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66.  GameStop stores \ud83c\udfea remain fun to shop and play at, and [GameStop.com](http://GameStop.com) \ud83d\udcbb \ud83d\udcf1 easily forms a shopping habit because it's so easy to use.  The customer service team is pleasant \ud83d\udcde.  I routinely choose [GameStop.com](http://GameStop.com) \u2728over dying sites such as '''Amazon''' \u2620.  So, where is the risk with this fascinating company?  Where is it?  When this gross, DTCC-infested market is cleaned up \\[*and it will be soon*\\], GameStop Corp is clearly #1.  Yet, trends from GameStop Corp's filings suggest that the company may even exit the DTCC-infested market altogether by entering the tokenized stock landscape.  So either way: **GameStop Corp** **wins** across the short term, medium term, and the long term.  I find that **GameStop Corp** is, therefore, a rare **Safe Haven stock that is immune to recessions**.  I do not even need to mention the other realities: that **GameStop Corp** has perhaps the most loyal shareholder base probably in stock market history \ud83c\udfdb.  GameStop Corp investors do not just 'l*ike' the above facts, nor do they simply just 'like'* the stock... Instead, there is a historic bond between shareholders: and there is a historic love for the real company behind which the shares mark personal ownership.\n\n# 4. TLDR\n\nGameStop Corp is anticipated to already have more than $4 Billion cash.  410 Million shares were transacted over the last 2 investing days.  Only 18% of that needed to be the share sale for it to be completed.  There is a high likelihood that offering is near-completed or completed.  Technicals reveal $25 psychological support held today, and a technical-rebound is safely anticipated.\n\nThis $4 Billion+ warchest was made even though GameStop Corp's share price is higher than it was when it had $2 Billion cash \\[*and then the share price is higher than it was when it had $1 Billion cash, etc*\\].  Typically, in \"*DiLuTiOn*,\" one would expect the share price to go down.  That did not happen here: even with this cash raise, GameStop Corp's share price still grew by a factor of 254.27% since the *long-term-higher-low* that was achieved in April.\n\nFurther, news from GameStop Corp's CEO, Ryan Cohen, is expected this week during the annual shareholder meeting.  Too there are rumors swirling about possible dividends in the form of digital collectibles, possible acquisitions using free cash, etc.  Yet, the analysis above did not need to consider any of these fundamental developments for the same conclusion to be further-solidified: that **MOASS is still in progress and it is still early.**  Substantial amounts of shares have to be purchased to cover the droves of strikes that are in the money.  There is some gamma impact here week by week, but the most important feature of this, however, are Failures-to-Deliver (FTDs).\n\nFTD delivery deadlines (*i.e. when to buy back and actually deliver the security after it was shorted without a locate*) are 35 calendar days from whence each FTD occurred.  These deadlines lead to 'stacked' time periods \\[*what I refer to as FTD trains*\\] of what would otherwise appear to be arbitrary buy volume applied to the stock. Compliance with SEC's Regulation SHO began in January 2005: Rule 204 of that is the cheat code that bad actors get *punch-drunk-greedy* off of before their bad bets do put global markets at risk.  Evidence shows that Volkswagen in 2008 saw a similar event that is occurring now with GameStop Corp: Naked Short Sellers had exploited the Rule 204 provision for FTDs *en masse* to support their irresponsible short bets.  It's a cheat code because they freely and flexibly get up to 35 days to buy the stock back - usually at cheaper prices (*i.e. a profit on their FTD'd-short every single time*).  With Volkswagen they became overwhelmed after just one FTD train.  The exact same FTD trains occurred from 2020-2021 with GameStop.  Naked short sellers became overwhelmed from two stacked FTD trains.  FTDs due for settlement/buyback will stack again for GameStop Corp in a few days: due to the FTDs that were generated during GameStop Corp's May price runup.", "What do you think about the rumors of Volkswagen factory closures and their potential impact? Hello, people of Germany. I\u2019m a foreigner who loves German cars. Yesterday, there was some grim news that the cost competition with China is intensifying, and Volkswagen's German factories might be at risk of closing. The automotive industry has a vast supply chain, and if factories shut down, it could have a significant impact on small and medium-sized suppliers. Do you really think Volkswagen will close its German factories? Also, what are your thoughts on the EU and Germany\u2019s EV policies?", "Not an idiot in a car, but something an idiot would do.

", "DD: Gamestop Price Analysis -- still a Deep Fucking Value under $550 **TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven\u2019t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.\n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*Edit\\* also see latest update (4/1): [Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi1a5r/our_whale_is_suppressing_volatility_to_bleed_hfs/)\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories.

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--> Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

Ford Motor was among Rivian\u2019s largest stakeholders, at roughly 12%, alongside Amazon when Rivian went public in 2021. The Detroit automaker sold a majority of its Rivian shares by 2023 after walking back a plan to codevelop EVs with the company.\n\nRivian reported a loss of $1.45 billion during the first quarter of this year, as it retooled its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV EVs ahead of its next-generation vehicles in 2026.\n\nThe company has been on a cost-cutting mission for months. It has trimmed staff, retooled its Illinois plant to increase efficiencies and paused construction of a new multibillion-dollar factory in Georgia. That last measure is expected to save more than $2.25 billion in capital spending, including the impact of starting production of Rivian\u2019s next-generation R2 vehicle at its plant in Illinois.\n\nRivian reported $7.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to end March, with more than $9 billion in total liquidity.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/volkswagen-rivian-stake.html", "The Coming Horrors Awaiting Shorts Part 4: The Purge **TLDR:**\n\n**Congratulations DTC.

It\u2019s me again, your neighborhood shit-talking, pun-writing, horror-centric DD autist, back to drop some more spicy findings and discuss what\u2019s happened (and what hasn\u2019t) since I first started writing DD about 4 months ago.\n\nAs always, please check out the prior parts of this DD series before diving into this if you haven\u2019t (especially part 1, which dives into the mechanics behind why a share dividend should have resulted in a large share recall\u2026more on that below!).\n\n# What Just Happened:\n\nSince part 3 of my DD 1-month ago, a whole host of things have happened.\n\nLet\u2019s get it straight from the source (GameStop Investor Relations).\n\n***\u201cOn July 6, 2022, GameStop announced a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective as of July 21, 2022, for stockholders of record on July 18, 2022.\u201d***\n\nOk Great!\n\nSo, GameStop conducted a Stock Split via share dividend and that went completely smoothly, because tons of other companies have done the same thing recently and nothing nefarious happened.\n\nNope nothing bad happened.\n\nWait\u2026what\u2019s that rumbling coming from across the pond?\n\nWhy are people swearing profusely in German?\n\nHmm\u2026why are shares being removed from overseas brokerage accounts? Why are tons of brokers now saying they were instructed by the DTCC to conduct a simple stock split instead of a share dividend?\n\nOh shit.\n\nWe are entering one of those horror movie scenarios again aren\u2019t we\u2026\n\n# THE PURGE:\n\nIn an America ravaged by financial crime, the government allows white collar criminals and professional money laundering scum pigs (oops, I mean hedge fund managers, bankers and market makers\u2026my bad), to conduct egregious acts of fraud and robbery without recourse, 24/7, 365.\n\nFolks like our friends at Generic Cuck Hedge Fund (GCHF) have enjoyed decades wrapping themselves in layers of protection while bankrupting companies, naked shorting businesses into oblivion, and robbing average Americans.\n\nThen GameStop happened, and suddenly, a cohort of extremely dedicated, laser-focused, obsessive investors realized what was going on.\n\nThese activist individual investors poured through financial records, stock charts, twitter threads, oh they tracked jets, took photos of buildings with lights on, stuck fruit into body cavities\u2026all in the name of uncovering the truth and helping the company they love, thrive.\n\nAlso\u2026they wanted their damn tendies.\n\nGameStop rewarded loyal shareholders with a share dividend that would result in a 4 to 1 stock split.\n\nInvestors everywhere rejoiced.\n\nOne DD writer (me) realized that shares being loaned out to short GameStop would be recalled before the dividend was distributed. And the promise of tens or hundreds of millions of shares being recalled held promises of many many many tendies. The price was going to go through the roof.\n\nLeading up to the share dividend split there was a decent price run-up to $151, but that\u2019s far from Uranus.\n\nEven worse, it looked like shares were still being made available to borrow. There was no mass recall. This DD writer, well, he started second guessing himself\u2026and he felt terrible that he potentially misled fellow investors.\n\nA few days after dividend distribution, a strange thing started happening. The price was shitting the bed. Then over the following weekend, shares started disappearing from overseas brokerage accounts, first in Germany, then others followed.\n\n**Something smelled like rotten, moldy, mayo.**\n\nThis past week, it became clear what had happened.\n\nThat whole share dividend thing GameStop issued.\n\n**Well it didn\u2019t f\\*cking happen\u2026at least not fully.**\n\nBrokers began describing to concerned investors that they were instructed by the DTC (A literal institutional Bernie Madoff), to just split existing shares. No dividend shares were received.\n\nGlobal Fraud was occurring. And for a few days, investors scrambled and interrogated brokers.\n\n**Then, our beloved company weighed in\u2026**\n\n*\"GameStop Guidance for International Stockholders with Split-Related QuestionsGameStop has notified its transfer agent and the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) that some of our valued stockholders in international geographies are still trying to determine if they have received the proper stock dividend associated with the Company\u2019s recent 4-for-1 stock split.* ***Please note GameStop has already distributed the shares of common stock required for the stock dividend to its transfer agent, which has confirmed it subsequently distributed the appropriate number of shares of common stock to DTC for allocation to brokerage firms and other participants.*** *We recommend that stockholders using a brokerage firm contact that firm with needs or questions. Stockholders may want to make their brokerage firm aware if they recently moved shares to the Company\u2019s direct registered list, as we have been informed this move could impact a firm\u2019s distribution of shares.We appreciate your investment and enthusiasm. Although we are not able to engage with individual brokerage firms, we are monitoring this situation and will keep you informed of any relevant updates we obtain through our transfer agent or DTC.\"*\n\n# Enter The Purge\n\nGameStop has officially confirmed that it has notified the DTC that some shareholders have not received dividend shares.\n\nGameStop is publicly confirming that it distributed the shares allocated from authorized reserves to be issued as dividends (please see part 1 for how that all works\u2026link is at the top of this post).\n\nAs a quick refresh, we voted to approve an expansion of authorized reserves (to allow GameStop a total of 1,000,000,000). That vote passed. GameStop then issued a 3 for 1 share dividend, issuing new shares from that 1,000,000,000 share pool.\n\nThose shares were distributed to Computer Share (GameStop\u2019s transfer agent in case you\u2019ve been tripping balls this whole time). Computer Share issued real dividend shares to all direct registered shares held by them (retail investors, insiders, etc.).\n\nThe rest of the shares\u2026they went to the DTC \u201cfor allocation to brokerage firms and other participants\u201d.\n\nSimple enough right\u2026except what happened to those leftover shares once they got to the DTC is a bit of a mystery since many brokers conducted a simple stock split.\n\nWhy would the DTC do that?\n\nThey had no choice because the number of dividend shares issued was far fewer than the number of shares (phantom shares\u2026aka IOUS\u2026aka naked shares sold short) held in brokerage accounts around the world.\n\nRemember, only real shares are entitled to a share dividend. And short positions are not entitled to a dividend (in fact they must locate dividend shares to the owner).\n\nSo yeah\u2026the DTC was in a bit of a pickle.\n\nWith potentially billions of IOUS and only hundreds of millions of shares to distribute\u2026the DTC most likely did the only thing it could, it filed the share dividend event as a standard stock split and brokers multiplied the IOUS in everyone\u2019s accounts x 4.\n\n# It\u2019s time for\u2026Math for Simple Minds\n\nLet\u2019s just pretend that 100 total shares of GameStop should exist pre share dividend.\n\nAnd let\u2019s pretend that 10 percent of those are held in Computershare (10 shares).\n\nAfter the dividend is issued and distributed, 400 shares of GameStop should now exist.\n\n40 shares should be held in computer share. 360 shares should be held by everyone else.\n\nThat\u2019s in a perfect beautiful world\u2026not the world we live in.\n\nWe know that the number of synthetic shares floating around is \u2026a lot.\n\nLet\u2019s be nice and just assume that only 10x the real number of shares exist (1000 shares for our simple example), before GameStop\u2019s share dividend.\n\n**How the DTC dun messed up:**\n\nGameStop\u2019s statement confirms that the dividend shares went to Computershare, computershare then presumably took real shares and issued them as dividend shares for its account holders\u2026then gave the rest to the DTC.\n\nThe DTC may have not issued any of those shares to brokers. That\u2019s possible based on what we know right now since it instructed brokers around the globe to treat GameStop\u2019s event as a standard forward stock split.\n\nIn our little scenario\u2026we said that there were 1,000 shares of GameStop floating around, and 100 of them were real.\n\n**Pre Split:**\n\n100 total real shares + 900 synthetics = 1000\n\n10 real shares held in Computershare\n\n90 real held in brokerage accounts\n\n900 synthetic shares held in brokerage accounts\n\n**Post Split:**\n\n400 real shares\n\n40 held in Computershare 360 held in brokerage accounts\n\n\u2026what happened to the synthetics?\n\nWell, if the DTC received 270 real shares from Computershare to distribute (300 \u2013 30), and issued none of them\u2026and instead told brokers to just split accounts by 4\u2026\n\n900 synthetics x 4 = 3,600 90 real broker shares x 4 = 360\n\n**Total Shares Post Split:**\n\n40 shares in Computershare (all real).\n\n270 shares held by the DTC (not distributed)\n\n3,600 synthetic shares that never were entitled to a share dividend\n\n90 real shares held in brokerage accounts that never received a real share\n\n270 new IOUS for the 90 real shares that should have come from the DTC\n\n**So now there are a total of:**\n\n400 real shares\n\n3,870 IOUs (we prefer to call them whoopsies)\n\nFor a total of 4,270 shares.\n\n# The Numbers Mason\u2026what do they mean?\n\nThe DTC took a bad problem and made it worse. By instructing brokers to split shares and failing to deliver dividend shares, it\u2019s accidentally rewarded every IOU floating around in a brokerage account with a share dividend of 3 extra shares.\n\nTo be clear, I don't even think it matters what the DTC did (or didn't) do with the shares it received from ComputerShare. Even if they distributed all of them, they still instructed every broker to multiply every IOU x 4.\n\nNot only is this massive securities fraud\u2026probably unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before\u2026but it\u2019s massively diluting the float of GameStop illegally.\n\nOh yeah, and it\u2019s a big effing problem if people could somehow\u2026you know\u2026start removing shares from the DTC and putting them in their own names.\n\nWelcome to the DRS purge.\n\n# Back to Our Story:\n\nWe\u2019re still living in crime-infested, security fraud-loving America, and our brave band of stock hodlers are now realizing that the DTC failed to deliver the share dividend, and instead conducted a stock split.\n\nAnd GameStop has weighed in, encouraging investors to press on their brokers about whether or not they received the dividends they are entitled to.\n\n**Oh\u2026and our favorite chair-man had something interesting to say on twitter:**\n\n**\u201cAsk not what your company can do for you-ask what you can do for your company\u201d**\n\nSuddenly it all dawns on many of the hodlers\u2026there is something they can do. They can start removing more and more shares from brokers and the DTC, direct registering them in their name.\n\nThey can lock the float, with a turbo boost, because the DTC just issued share dividends via a split for every synthetic share held in an account, and potentially failed to deliver all or most of the shares it received from ComputerShare, creating even more IOUs in the process.\n\nHoards of crazed, devoted, and highly sophisticated investors descend upon their brokerages, ripping shares away, knowing that it doesn't matter if the shares they are sending to Computershare are fake or synthetic...because the second they go to ComputerShare they become real.\n\nIt's a magical, real-share printing machine.\n\nAnd it's ready for all of us to use (not financial advice...but seriously, this is a golden ticket to take fraudulent shares and legally make them real!).\n\nWelcome to the great share purge.\n\nThe fatal mistake has already occurred\u2026(issuing dividends to ious and likely failing to deliver all the shares from Computershare), now it's every investor's opportunity to perform the fatality and help lock the entire free float of the company.\n\n# There Will Be Blood\n\nMy original hypothesis was that because of the share dividend, brokers would recall all of their shares on loan before the ex-date (to avoid massive tax obligations). This would force shorts to close positions and repurchase shares. This purchasing should have produced an explosive price increase leading up to the dividend issuance.\n\nI was effing perplexed at first when this didn\u2019t happen. When I was on Houston Wade\u2019s livestream discussing the aftermath, the issues with the dividend hadn\u2019t yet surfaced.\n\nBut now it\u2019s clear to me that the DTC screwed my original thesis.\n\nI am very confident that if they had followed GameStop\u2019s corporate instructions, and filed the share dividend properly, the scenario I described would have occurred.\n\nBut what I did not foresee in my original DD was this option by the DTC\u2026to receive shares, ignore instructions, and instead tell brokers to split shares.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t brokers recall shares on loan massively?\n\nBecause the DTC told them they were not processing this as a share-dividend, but rather a split. No share dividend\u2026no reason to recall shares, no potentially taxable event to avoid.\n\nBut rejoice brothers and sisters\u2026**for there will be blood.**\n\nNow that GameStop has issued a public statement on the share dividend issues, the game is officially on.\n\n**In my smooth-brained opinion this now ends in one of these ways:**\n\n**Option 1:**\n\nWe DRS-the shit out of our shares (including all of the synthetics that the DTC allowed brokers to multiply), and we lock the majority of the float fairly quickly. If the DTC failed to deliver the shares from compute share, it created even more synthetics hanging out in brokerage accounts.\n\nThis has the potential to be akin the decentralized version of Porsche publicly announcing that they controlled the vast majority of Volkswagen, setting in motion the infamous VW squeeze.\n\nOnce GameStop announces DRS numbers that indicate a vast majority of the shares have been locked up, a frenzy of buying and closing sets off, and we head straight to Uranus.\n\n**Option 2:**\n\nWe keep DRS\u2019ing the shit out of the float\u2026and simultaneously GameStop issues an NFT dividend via wallets on it\u2019s NFT marketplace. That could include an NFT dividend related to a spinoff company like Gm'erica.\n\nWith the newest updates to its wallet (including the ability to pay the small fee to activate a layer 2 wallet by sending an NFT), the infrastructure is in place to do this.\n\nWe get two simultaneous squeezes (one for the NFT dividends on the marketplace and one for shares of GameStop). GameStop rakes in tons of revenue in fees for processing all of these transactions on its marketplace.\n\nWin-win baby.\n\n**Option 3:**\n\nGameStop follows through on its threat to remove shares from the DTC, and there is a 90 day doomsday scenario set in motion. All shorts must be closed before GameStop removes its shares and the price goes to Uranus in the process.\n\nGameStop relists itself as a tokenized security on a new block-chain based exchange.\n\nI think this scenario is the least likely, only because I still have doubts that a blockchain based stock exchange is ready yet from a mass-adoptioin/technological maturity standpoint.\n\n**Option 4:**\n\nSomeone like our friends at Generic Cuck Hedge Fund (GCHF) blows up before any of the first 3 scenarios comes to fruition and sets of a chain reaction of liquidations.\n\n**Wrapping it Up:**\n\nIf you are on the fence about whether or not DRS-ing the ever loving shit out of your shares is the way....please go back and read this again, and reflect on what just happened. The DTC did the only thing it could (screw over brokers and hope that nobody would notice their gigantic fraud).\n\nBut it was a huge mistake. It just turbo-charged our ability to lock up the float, exert ever-increasing pressure on short positions, and continue to remove liquidity from the market.\n\nNone of this is financial advice of course. If you like collecting fake shares for some reason, well i guess YOLO.\n\nNow more than ever though, it's becoming increasingly clear that the path to MOASS tendies revolves around individual retail investors taking their fate into their own hands, by DRS-ing shares, and continuing to support the company they love.\n\nAs always, remember, there's nobody coming to rescue us from the outside. The SEC, DTC, banks, brokers, and everyone else, they aren't going to be our Gandalf in this fight.\n\nGood thing we no longer need any of them! Seriously, I believe we are now in the end-game (I don't know how long that lasts, but things have substantially accelerated in my view).\n\nBuckle up!", "As things continue to unravel, I'm inclined to post this again: We're in 2008 on repeat and I'll show you From [one of my posts a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/svl80n/were_in_2008_on_repeat_ill_show_you/) I wanted to show the newer apes and those who didn't see it the first time.

That is, Goldman Sachs, at the direction of Paulson, hand-picked mortgages that were certain to go bad, and stuffed the mortgages (or rather, \u201csynthetic\u201d derivatives of the mortgages) into collateralized debt obligations that temporarily masked the true value of the loans.\n\n> Goldman isn\u2019t the only bank that created these CDOs. Deutsche Bank, UBS, and smaller outfits, such as Tricadia Inc., perpetrated similar scams. All told, well over $250 billion worth of these\u00a0 \u201csynthetic\u201d CDOs were sold into the market in the two years leading up to the financial crisis of 2008. Indeed, there is a distinct possibility that a majority of all the CDOs sold during those two years were deliberately designed to implode by hedge fund managers who were betting against both the CDOs and the financial system as a whole.\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's [what they were doing](https://www.deepcapture.com/2010/01/john-paulson-and-the-greatest-pump-and-short-fraud-ever/)\n\n> An example of a particularly sordid scheme, orchestrated by hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, was discovered some time ago by David Fiderer, a blogger for the Huffington Post. The information in Fiderer\u2019s blog is rather incriminating, and, of course, the mainstream media is not on the case, so I think it bears repeating.\n\n> As Fiderer explains, Paulson asked the banks to create those CDOs \u201cso that they could be sold to some suckers at close to par. That way, Paulson\u2019s hedge fund could approach some other sucker who would sell an insurance policy, or credit default swap, on the newly minted CDOs. Bear, Deutsche and Goldman knew perfectly well what Paulson\u2019s motivation was. He made no secret of his belief that the CDOs subordinate claims on the mortgage collateral were close to worthless. By the time others have figured out the fatal flaws in these securities which had been ignored by the rating agencies, Paulson could collect up to $5 billion.\n\n> \u201cPaulson not only initiated these transactions, he also specified the terms he wanted, identifying which mortgages would be stuffed into the CDOs, and how the CDOs should be structured. Within the overall framework set by Paulson\u2019s team, banks and investors were allowed to do some minor tweaking.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe only guy to go to jail, [was running from this](https://www.deepcapture.com/2009/01/strange-occurrences-and-a-story-about-naked-short-selling/) and turned himself in (this story includes Jim Cramer) \n\n> Evidence suggests that Bernard Madoff, the \u201cprominent\u201d Wall Street operator and former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, had\u00a0ties to the Russian Mafia, Moscow-based oligarchs, and the Genovese organized crime family.\n\n> And, as\u00a0reported by\u00a0Deep Capture\u00a0and\u00a0Reuters, Madoff did not just orchestrate a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.

The GameStop case, the signals of Hedge Funds and the rise of cryptocurrencies\n\nby Nicola Sindaco\n\n\n##Is there a link between the GameStop case, the surge in cryptocurrency prices (primarily Bitcoin), and the recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos? The overexposure of financial players, made possible by the quantitative easing policies of central banks in the Covid era, and the lowering of the level of credit risk, in a context of increasing deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, is increasingly attracting financial actors with a high propensity to risk, with the imminent risk of triggering a new, devastating financial crisis.\n\n\n#The roots of the last crisis (and the next one?): deregulation and non-regulation\n\n\nThe financialization of the world economy promoted by American President Bill Clinton with the signing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999, which went down in history with the journalistic epithet deregulation, turns out to be the key to shedding light on the origin of latest recent global financial crisis. The deregulation repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which previously prohibited so-called BanCorp (bank holding companies) from controlling other financial institutions, marking a boundary between commercial, investment banks, Hedge Funds, other investment funds and insurance institutions, and standardizing made the enlarged banking and financial system under a single risk model.\n\n\nPreviously, slackening tendencies had already been in place since 1997 with the decision of the then President of the Federal Reserve (FED) Alan Greenspan to keep the derivatives market and Shadow Banking completely deregulated (i.e. the sector of investment funds and large financial institutions that act as banks without being de facto). In addition, the relaxation of the equity rule approved in April 2004 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), repealing the text of the same 1975 law, allowed large financial institutions (with capital exceeding 5 billion dollars) to simply submit their exemption file to the SEC in order to decide autonomously its own net capital, or rather its net liquidity buffer to be used as a guarantee of solvency of the investment portfolio.\n\n\nThe non-regulation of Shadow Banking and the deregulation of the global financial system meant that speculative instruments such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) could be used as balances (_hedge_) against credit risk without the parties involved having anything to do with the stipulation of the original credit / debt contract and therefore without necessarily having to own the debt instrument (share, bond or derivative). As a result, the volume of CDS increased a hundredfold in the decade 1998-2008 and the trend had already been noticed in 2003 by the famous investor Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, leading him to define the derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".\n\n\nThe financial crisis rooted in the aforementioned legislative choices then found fertile ground in the creative work of BanCorps, in particular in the form of subprime mortgages and derivatives such as _Collateralized Default Obligations_ (CDO) and the aforementioned Credit Default Swaps. The swelling of the American real estate bubble, the easy access to credit for banking institutions and their customers, added to the attitudes that can be placed in the grey of the law and the fraudulent attitudes of the actors involved, led the entire system to experience peaks of financial euphoria. results in overleveraging (excessive exposure to the risk of default) and subsequently in the collapse of the entire house of cards.\n\n\nIf deregulation has acted as a systemic catalyst, the American real estate bubble can be seen as the spark and overleveraging should be understood as an amplifier of the spread of the fire. The domino effect was such as to lead to the collapse of the American economy first and then the world one within 18 months (from the first bankruptcy due to subprime in April 2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns in 2008), recording in the first quarter of 2009 a violent decline of the major world stock exchanges equal to 9.8% for the Eurozone, with peaks of 14.4% in Germany, 15.2% in Japan and 21.5% in Mexico.\n\n\nThe decade 2010-2020 then subsequently experienced the aftermath of the global financial crisis, seeing the European debt crisis worsening (2009-2012), preceded by the collapse of entire national financial systems such as the Icelandic one and real defaults such as the Greek one, as well as register an unemployment rate of 10%.\n\n\n#Between creative finance and expansive monetary policies\n\n\nThe new decade did not start in the best way for the planet, and not only from an economic-financial point of view. The advent of Covid-19 has forced governments to apply extreme measures to a total national lock-down in an attempt to contain the pandemic expansion. In March 2020, the markets responded to the Covid factor with a vertical decline very similar to that recorded eleven years earlier due to the financial crisis, but the important _Quantitative Easing_ measures implemented by the major global economic powers meant that the markets restarted quickly. and reached the highest peaks ever reached in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\nDespite the apparent recovery, some values \u200b\u200bare altered and the impact of these alterations does not seem to have yet been quantified at a macro-economic level, although it is not known to date whether the problem has been faced behind closed doors in the halls of power. of the world economy and finance. All that remains is to ask questions and try to suggest answers pending further data, details and official confirmations.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have been preparing to launch aggressively expansionist policies to cauterize the wound suddenly opened by Covid-19; but at what price? Although journalistically and morally evaluated as a commendable effort, the constant stimulus packages directly paid by the States into the pockets of citizens, the transversal injections of capital that have made the entire economic-financial fabric more liquid (from private companies to credit institutions) and the relaxation of lending and repayment policies have exponentially increased the working capital, leading to fears of the advent of hyper-inflationary waves, as well as increasing the systemic risk in relation to credit exposure.\n\n\nIn reality, inflationary peaks have not occurred, especially in consideration of the fact that generally these are recorded in situations where there is a convergence of three factors:\n\n* excess liquidity;\n* full employment;\n* high speed of circulation.\n\nThe pandemic has practically acted as a barrier to inflation, preventing the fulfilment of points 2 and 3 just listed. At the same time, the surge in stock markets after the collapse of March 2020 is to be considered financed more by these liquidity injections into the world economy than directly proportional to the growth of gross world product.\n\n\n#The Bitcoin boom and the new digital asset economy\n\n\nA good idea on the subject is provided by the surge in the prices of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, obviously headed by Bitcoin. A necessary digression is needed to give context. Ten years after its appearance, Bitcoin appears to be the asset with the best performance, that is, with the best economic return (ROI) in the world. To give an example, HowMuch.net (financial education site) calculated that 100 $ invested at the beginning of 2009 in today's best multinationals (such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook) would have produced the following results:\n\n* Facebook 520 $ = + 420%\n* Microsoft $ 1,000 = + 899%\n* Apple 2.400 $ = + 2.345%\n* Amazon $ 3,300 = + 3.156%\n\nIn the same period (January 2009 - December 2019), $ 100 invested in Bitcoin would have recorded the following growth:\n\n* Bitcoin $ 9,200,000 = 9,150,088%\n\nObviously, the number is calculated on the values \u200b\u200bof December 2019, when 1 Bitcoin was available for purchase for $ 7,500. Today, in April 2021, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to approximately $ 57,500, a further + 750% compared to the above figure of $9.2M. Without wishing to go into the merits of the use-case of Bitcoin and the innovative concept of blockchain, the Bitcoin case serves the purpose of demonstrating how the surge in prices in the last twelve months or so is dictated by the excess of new printed currency.\n\n\nIntrinsic features of Bitcoin are network security (non-hackability of the system), scarcity (there is a finite number of Bitcoins and once in circulation no more can be produced) and the democratized supply system. These characteristics, [read through the lens provided by \"Metcalfe's law\"]([https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa](https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa) have allowed many economists and mathematicians to make really ambitious predictions for the price of Bitcoin in the future. Originally presented in 1980 by Robert Metcalfe to describe the impact of telephony in an exponentially proportional manner to the increase of telephones in society (_compatible communicating devices_, the theory was later refined by George Gilder in 1993 and applied to Ethernet. In its basic form, the law states that the value of the telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to the system (n\u00b2), where n equals the number of nodes.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco1.jpg\n\nTo put it simply, the value of a network is proportional to the number of participants in the network squared. This law applies to the growth of Bitcoin to perfection, showing perfect correlation between the increase in the number of Bitcoin addresses (wallet addresses) and the increase in the price.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco2-1024x633.jpg\n\nThis correlation has led to multiple projections and forecasts, the most famous of which is that of PlanB (where B stands for Bitcoin), a Dutch institutional investor with an academic background in quantitative law and finance, which through its Stock-To-Flow Model (S2F) elaborated and published in March 2019 had predicted a value of $ 55,000 for Bitcoin by 2021, or a market capitalization of $ 1 trillion (at the time of the forecast, Bitcoin was valued at $ 4,000 and in its ten-year history it had reached $ 20,000 per coin just once, at the peak of December 2017).\n\n\nBitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the famous white paper of October 31, 2008 and the first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and its open source code was made accessible to the world on January 8, 2009; as described and envisaged in the white paper, Bitcoin not only has a predefined maximum quantity - Hard Cap - but is \"mined\" block by block, Proof-of-Work after Proof-of-Work (PoW), through mining (\"extraction \"). Every 210,000 blocks - approximately every four years - the amount of \"mineable\" Bitcoin halves in a process known as halving.\n\n\nThe PlanB model tracks the past, present and future value of Bitcoin in correlation with increasing scarcity:\n\n* Stock = is the quantity of existing product/currency/commodity (in this case of Bitcoin);\n* Flow = is the annual production of the asset in question;\n\nThe following tab will serve as an example:\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco3.jpg\n\nGold records a stock-to-flow (SF) of 62, implying that it would take 62 years of production to reach the quantity of product existing today; for silver it takes 22 years and this makes both assets excellent reserves of monetary value.\n\nIn the following graph, the regression line drawn to better plot the entered data confirms the impression that one has with the naked eye: a statistically significant relationship between SF and market value (note that the model is based on production halving - _Halving_- as shown on the right and the value is calculated on a logarithmic scale as shown on the left - covering 8 orders of magnitude).\n\nIt turns out to be quite interesting that gold and silver, while being completely different markets, are in line with the values \u200b\u200bof the Bitcoin model regarding the SF.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco4.jpg\n\nThe then visionary forecast was then followed by another equally \"reckless\" one, which estimated the market capitalization of Bitcoin at around 5.5 trillion dollars, or $ 288,000 per coin before the advent of the next Halving (April 19, 2024).\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco5.jpg\n\nTo date, Bitcoin seems to follow PlanB's S2F Model to the letter.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco6.jpg\n\nIn fact, the speed with which Bitcoin reached the value of $ 55,000 ($ 1 trillion Market Cap) was found to be excessive according to many analysts and led to the conclusion that the value of Bitcoin and the stock market in general are extremely inflated, this is precisely because of the recent capital injections by governments around the world.\n\nAccording to a survey by Mizuho Securities on March 15, 40 billion dollars of the 380 ready to be injected into the American economy will be allocated for investments and two out of five people (40%) said they would prefer to bet on Bitcoin rather than invest in traditional assets.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco7.jpg\n\n\n#A new crisis on the horizon\n\n\nThe liquidity injection recorded in the last twelve months in the United States alone has seen the amount of dollars in circulation (2 trillion) increase by an incredible 40%, accelerating the devaluation of the currency. This devaluation may not be immediately recognizable in the real economy, as the lock-down measures have significantly slowed down the speed of circulation and the pandemic has generally aggravated the unemployment rate; but the symptoms are definitely noticeable in the financial market, with the peaks recorded by all the assets in circulation: commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds.\n\n\nHow are these signs indicators of a possible dire future? The thesis we support is that of the overvaluation of all markets, deriving from the over-exposure of financial actors (_overleveraging_) a situation made possible by the policies of quantitative easing, injections of currency at zero interest by central banks (FED in primis) and the lowering of the level of credit risk (i.e. an easier access to credit for large financial institutions in order to \u201cPumping\u201d liquidity into the economy across the board). These circumstances, added to the deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, have attracted more and more financial players with a high propensity to risk, as their success is calculated purely quantitatively following the \"Two and Twenty\" law:\n\n\n* 2% of the managed capital (_Asset Under Management_) is the commission received regardless of the results;\n* 20% of profits is the commission received upon completion of a successful transaction.\n\nThis rule, juxtaposed with the very nature of Hedge Funds, ie their being \"resource aggregators\" (coming from the fund's investors / financiers) and mere \"managers\" of the latter, together with the lewd climate from a legislative and expansive point of view, as well as from a monetary point of view, they are triggering a credit overexposure mechanism that could risk a real _systemic failure_ if you do not act in time.\n\nHedge Funds are high risk / return vehicles of speculation and operate with short-term maneuvers in order to maximize the return; among the strategies most used by these funds is _levering_, debt-based investment and short-selling. The expansionism recorded in the last decade of monetary policies, the extreme _quantitative easing_ of the last twelve months to cope with the pandemic crisis, added to the zero interest rate policy by central banks, have created a liquidity tsunami that has led to a very risky relaxation of the credit sector. It should be noted that the institutional financial system is the de facto lung of a country's finance and economy. The zero interest decided by the hyper-expansionary monetary policies poured liquidity into the financial and credit sector starting from the credit institutions, then expanding like wildfire towards insurance institutions, pension funds, Hedge Funds and, due to the (_trickle- down effect_), flooded the financial market and the world stock exchanges.\n\nThe mechanism is quite elementary: credit institutions are incentivized to accumulate interest-free liquidity from central banks; the operators, or the bankers, earn commissions, that is a percentage of the money lent, therefore they are incentivized to give loans; and the greater flows of credit capital are required by investment funds, which in turn use the available capital to obtain deeper lines of credit and at the same time earn 2% of the assets managed (resulting in an extremely incentive to credit exposure) . Obviously, all these institutions use insurance institutions to protect their operations in the event of a default / bankruptcy of one of the creditors, and these institutions in turn tend to mitigate their default risk through debt collateralisation and Credit Default Swaps.\n\nIt goes without saying that as long as the market wind blows in the direction of the big investors, profits are calculated in billions of dollars and the system thrives; the problem begins to arise when the market becomes almost impracticable even for these subjects despite being highly specialized, equipped and financed.\n\n#The GameStop case: Hedge Fund vs. Wall Street Bets\n\nWhen at the end of January 2021 the GME title of the video game retail chain GameStop reached $ 483 in value on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the world did not notice and few knew the story behind the surge. the price; even today, very few know what is happening and it is our intention to shed light on one of the potentially most important events in the financial history of the last ten years and which could perhaps mark the future of the economy and finance by forcing the American legislator (and many others to follow) to change the rules of the game.\n\nA dutiful preamble: the GameStop company has been living its third age for years and its business model based on stores and sales of consoles and video games is going in the same terminal direction as that of a giant of the past that has failed today: Blockbuster. GME stock has for years mirrored what Wall Street thought of its archaic business model: the tendency to bankruptcy. The value of the stock has performed in a range between 4-5 dollars for years with no movements whatsoever, almost waiting for the coup de grace. Even before the pandemic, many financial players (in particular Hedge Funds) took advantage of the weakness and corporate immobility to speculate on the failure and consequential de-listing of the stock from the stock exchange. This speculation took place in the form of short selling: this is a common practice in finance, which is equivalent to a bet \"against\" the performance of a company, or by making the investor gain the more the company is in bankruptcy.\n\nIn April 2020, when the panic generated by the lock-down measures hit the world stock exchanges, the stock collapsed to an all-time low to touch $ 2.60 and indirectly confirming to investors that they had aimed against the company's survival. that their assumptions were well founded, incentivizing them to double their shorting positions assuming that the lock-down would deliver the final coup de grace. Meanwhile, other investors around the world have assessed the company's future differently, in conjunction with the fact that the new consoles are still producing slots for reading CDs and DVDs and therefore total digitization seems to be still far away, as far as the horizon is concerned. Investors such as Michael Burry (CEO of Scion Asset Management and the first ever to predict the American real estate bubble) and Ryan Cohen (CEO and founder of Chewy, the world's leading e-commerce company in the sale of pet products) have read great potential in the company and certainly in the GME stock, considering it undervalued.\n\nTheir considerations throughout 2020 were then adopted by some small investors (retail investors) headed by the Youtuber \"RoaringKitty\", known on the Reddit platform under the pseudonym of u/ DeepF \u2014 ingValue, born Keith Patrick Gill. By the end of 2020, Cohen had bought 13% of the company's stock while the stock had risen from $ 2.60 to around $ 20. The situation was hot for many Hedge Funds, who found themselves overexposed in their shorting strategy against a stock that had seen its value multiply 7.7 times its lowest price (far from bankruptcy!). Meanwhile, the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, on which Gill continued to post his analyzes, comments and evidence of his investments, had adopted the title in a sort of protest against finance, like an Occupy Wall Street 2.0.\n\nThis protest, combined with genuine consideration of the potential of the GME stock and the GameStop company to transform with Cohen's entry into the board of directors, has resulted in a bulk purchase of the stock on every online trading platform accessible to the small investor. The stock jumped from $ 20 to $ 483 in just a few days, reducing some Hedge Funds almost to the streets, the most affected of which was undoubtedly Melvin Capital (to which the Citadel Securities fund with 2.75 billion dollars had to come to the rescue. and Point72 with 750 million bailouts). The surge triggered a sudden Short Squeeze, or the rush to buy back shares by those actors who had bet on the fall to contain the losses resulting from the surge; buyback that combined with the pressure of the surge itself tends to exacerbate the volume of purchases by inflating the value of the shares in question: the catalyst was the discovery by the \"people of Reddit\" that the shares subject to shorting were more than 100% of the number of existing official shares, implying that the shorters were applying the technique of Naked Short Selling (the practice of selling \"shares short\", or the sale of a security without having possession of it, not receiving it on loan or even making sure that this loan possibly possible) and \"producing\" \"synthetic\", \"derivative\" actions and placing oneself in the condition of being subject to squeeze.\n\nIn the following weeks, the stock fell in what initially appeared to be the deflation of the bubble, or the natural _post-squeeze_ regression of a stock towards its real market value (as happened in 2008 for Volkswagen stock). In fact, due to the non-regulation of Hedge Funds and the fact that short positions are not subject to quarterly disclosure to the SEC, the small investors who meet in droves daily on Reddit and discuss the topic have continued (and continue to date) to speculate and argue that the squeeze has not yet occurred and the fall in the share price is only the result of market manipulation. In January, the value of the stock was held back by the work of the actors most at risk, namely Hedge Funds and online trading platforms. During the hectic stages of the takeover, small investors were cut off from buying shares and found the purchase functionality blocked on their trading apps (the shares could only be sold). Platforms such as Robinhood have been accused of collusion with big funds by small investors who flooded Twitter, Reddit (r/WallStreetBets; r/Gamestop ; r/Superstonk) and the message boards of the same trading platforms with messages of revenge and threats of class action.\n\n\nThe chaos generated by the deflation of the stock, which reached $ 38.50 in February, combined with heavy accusations of collusion and financial manipulation, forced the American Congress to request a [hearing on the matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html?) in which all the actors in question were called to testify, including Youtuber \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d Gill. Starting from the hearing, the stock has regained ground and between the end of February and the beginning of March it touched up the $ 350 in a tight growth without hint of a slowdown (a symptom that the squeeze is still in progress), so much so as to force operators on the other part of the market (the shorters) to use whatever means at their disposal to stop the price surge (_ladder attacks, naked short selling, married puts, synthetic longs, discardable deep in the money calls, dark pools_, etc. are all tactics existing that it is only possible to speculate have been implemented as they are of dubious legality and there is no certain evidence of their use). The stock's value plummeted again in late March to $ 120 and at the time of this analysis it is hovering between $ 140-160.\n\nThe question that arises spontaneously is whether and in what way this saga can be relevant for a broader macro-economic discourse. The stock has now stopped moving in parallel with the company and the extremely positive news that is perceived of an imminent transformation (starting with the appointment of the new board of directors). Today the stock seems at the mercy of far more powerful forces, even higher than the power of Hedge Funds who would like to see it collapse completely. The forces in question represent the real tip of the balance in an attempt to prevent the dreaded systemic failure. The work of these forces would also coincide with the most important and violent interference of the American legislator in the affairs of the free market while these are still in progress, with all due respect to the \"invisible hand\" of Adam Smith.\n\n#Change of course or change of the rules of the game?\n\nAt the top of the American market sits an independent government agency completely disconnected from the traditional executive, acting under the aegis of special statutes and accountable for its work in Congress, which can request ad hoc hearings and appoints the top. The agency in question is the SEC, established in the 1930s following the Collapse of '29 and the subsequent Great Depression. The work of the SEC is supported at system level (not by statute) by the Depository Trust &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a private company that provides clearing and settlement services to the financial market, or which acts as an arbiter of all transactions financial statements so that these are respected and all the suspended ones are covered up to the point of establishing themselves as the \"ultimate guarantor\" in order to ensure compliance with each transaction. Established in 1999 with the function of integrating the work of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), DTCC is now ranked among the top 500 companies in the world by Fortune magazine.\n\nThese entities have repeatedly found themselves embroiled in thorny litigation, receiving heavy accusations from small listed companies and legal offices for having constantly closed their eyes to the work of Hedge Funds in the field of _Naked Short Selling_. To the harsh criticism, the DTCC has always responded that the problem was not so extensive as to warrant regulation and, while the SEC acknowledges the existence of the problem, it has in turn always supported the DTCC in case of legal proceedings.\n\nThe GameStop case is changing the rules of the game en passant, or at least causing this change of course. Since the request for a hearing by Congress, the SEC and the DTCC have had multiple meetings behind closed doors to address the problem and find a solution that reduces the systemic risk of default. To date, the DTCC has produced important legislative changes to the procedures in place, with particular attention to the issues of _failure to deliver_ (FTD, i.e. the impossibility of repaying a debt, honouring a contract or returning a previously loaned security) and Naked Short Selling. As can be seen from the following graph on the [SEC website](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=GME), the FTD against the GME stock is now standard and, as later documented by Bloomberg in a [spicy article on the subject](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/sec-data-show-359-million-of-gamestop-shares-failed-to-deliver), over 358 million dollars in shares in January 2021 were not returned resulting in FTD.\n\nhttps://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco8.jpg\n\nClearly, [fines are foreseen if FTD is incurred](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/penalty-for-failure-to-deliver-common-stock), but by now it seems that Hedge Funds prefer to incorporate the latter as a \"management cost\" to stay in business rather than worrying about acting according to the law and avoiding the infringement: the reward, obviously , is exponentially more attractive than any fine to be paid. To this distortion, the DTCC responded last March with a [plan]([https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/86649/dtcc-proposes-three-point-plan-for-derivatives-trade-reporting-data-harmonisation) for the harmonization of data communication concerning derivatives and numerous [new rules](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings) are awaiting implementation that tighten the circle around the derivatives sector and the work of the most reckless. financial actors.\n\nThese new rules seem to demonstrate that the DTCC is clearly aware of the distortions initially considered \"irrelevant\" or \"little branched\" in the system; moreover, since DTCC is a private company, it knows very well that it is the ultimate guarantor of all financial transactions on the American market; ergo knows very well that in the event of a short squeeze and possible bankruptcy of large financial actors, a nefarious domino effect would be triggered which would lead to a series of insurance liquidations and margin calls (i.e. the forced liquidation of the entire investment portfolio of a debtor to ensure that the creditor can recover the capital lent totally or partially) as happened to the Lehman Brothers bank and to the AIG insurance company in 2008, which in the event of default would see the DTCC forced to stand as the last \"debtor\" towards the market (since precisely the ultimate guarantor).\n\n#The Archegos case: has the domino effect already begun?\n\nAwareness of the excessive systemic risk caused by the overexposure of large financial players is convincing the DTCC and SEC to work together to ensure that from a legislative point of view they are not ultimately footing the bill for what could be the largest party. expensive in the history of American and world finance. But time is running out.\n\nThe recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos Capital Management has exposed the risks of the investment banking and shadow banking sector. When Archegos found himself unable to respond to margin call requests from his creditors at the end of the first quarter, all he had to do was declare bankruptcy. Where does the international media apprehension about the affair derive from? From the fact that Archegos has recorded the largest loss by a single company or fund since the days of Lehman Brothers: 20 billion dollars in two days. [Operators such as Credit Suisse]([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout) and Nomura, overexposed in the granting of loans to Archegos, had to record exorbitant losses at the end of the first quarter and suffered a further double blow with the loss of ground on the stock exchange of their respective stocks (11% and 14%) and with the loss of important capital by other large investors who preferred to migrate their liquidity to safer and less stormy shores (in the most classic of panic runs).\n\nWhat is worrying is not only the colossal loss generated by the Archegos bankruptcy, the turmoil caused in the market by the forced sale of the shares held by Archegos and used as collateral payment to creditors, and the concatenating losses of investment banks such as Credit Suisse and Nomura; what worries further is that a fund sponsored by the major Wall Street and international brokers (GoldmanSachs, JPMorgan, Nomura and Credit Suisse) was almost non-existent in the SEC's EDGAR database (_Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval_), or the inherent data collection public disclosure of financial transactions. The DTCC and SEC are hard at work trying to change the rules of the game in an attempt to protect the system (and themselves) from the excessive risks that the Archegos case has laid bare.\n\n#Conclusions: The Game Stops?\n\nOn the one hand we have the frenzied race against time of the institutions to change the legislative fabric so that the system is more protected and can better absorb bankruptcies of the size of the Archegos fund should they unexpectedly reappear (and given the low propensity to disclose information, it is expected that such bankruptcies continue to occur \"without notice\"); on the other hand we have the GameStop case which shows no signs of deflating and still seems to be positioned for a [_violent Short Squeeze_]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html) (the Melvin Capital fund declared losses equal to 49% of its capital at the end of the first quarter).\n\nThe next two months will be among the hottest ever for the stock, all investors (on both sides of the market) and supervisory agencies. What is most worrying at the moment is the possible result of an uncontrolled squeeze, a scenario that we hope the institutions are considering in order to create a legislative structure around it that can support the pressure and defuse the risk of a systemic crisis. It goes without saying that the investors who back GameStop and aim for the squeeze (because they are fans of the company, because they are mere speculators, or because of a desire for revenge against Wall Street) are looking forward to seeing the stock fly on the stock market and see it fail and declare bankruptcy. Hedge Funds that bet against them. However romantic the happy ending of David defeating the financial Goliath of our times is, it is important to understand the repercussions of a possible fall of these funds on the global financial fabric and how to organize the chessboard so that the system comes out unscathed whatever it is. the outcome of the dispute.\n\nWhat DTCC and SEC are trying to understand is how to stem a 2008 crisis-style domino effect, where a hedge fund's margin call could result not only in its bankruptcy but in an excessive loss of capital for its creditors as well (banks of investment) and the insurance institutions that act as guarantors of the operations. And given the risk balancing practice that sees banks exchanging Credit Default Swaps and insurance companies do the same, these \"protective\" practices against a possible collapse of one of the parties would act as a true link and common thread that could trigger the downfall of all. the domino pieces. More margin calls, more bankruptcies of funds, credit institutions and insurance companies would trigger a financial crisis greater in size than those of the subprime (2008), the Nasdaq(2000) and the Great Depression (1929) with the financial panic that would ensue, branching off in a widespread manner and seriously affecting all sectors of the economy, including households and savings. We would see the fastest collapse in the history of financial indices given the large number of existing online trading platforms; assets considered as a store of value such as gold, silver, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would generally experience unprecedented exponential growth (also placing these markets at bubble risk, but that's another topic). The short squeeze of GME stock could be the catalyst of the crisis and DTCC and SEC are extremely aware of the situation.\n\nCreating a legislative structure around the squeeze is the only conceivable solution at the moment, considering that the company's official shares are about 70 million and that the total number in the market is much higher (although not officially quantifiable) in the form of synthetic shares (final product of the practice of Naked Short Selling), making the squeeze difficult to avoid. And time is running out, as GameStop has announced its annual shareholders' meeting for June 9th and the recount of the shares will start from the sixtieth day before the meeting, and the feeling is that starting from this date there will be a sort of curfew and all overdrafts must be covered and the shares re-entered for the counting officer.\n\nArchegos served as an alarm bell for the system to wake up and act to protect itself; GameStop is adding momentum for this to happen quickly. As outside observers, we are confident that the agencies involved will be able to untie the Gordian knot and ensure the security of the system. Our conviction derives from the awareness that these agencies are extremely resilient and when their very survival is put at risk they pull out their claws and there is no outside interest that cares: only their survival counts; luckily, their survival to date is directly linked to ours and that of the global financial system.\n\nEdit: formatting.\n\n[Link to original](https://www.futurimagazine.it/scenari/siamo-sullorlo-di-una-nuova-crisi-finanziaria-il-caso-gamestop-i-segnali-degli-hedge-funds-e-lascesa-delle-criptovalute/)\n\nThanks for the awards! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin and stock market are inflated, liquidity problems, possible crash connected to GME.", "A certain \"idiosyncratic\" stock, famed for its 'Negative Beta' tendencies, once again seems to performing contrarian to the overall market... ", "\ud83d\udc8e I was wrong once, but never again. Here are the reasons for our real MOASS timeline. (Ich liege nicht mehr falsch. Hier ist die eigentliche Zeitachse f\u00fcr MOASS) \u270a The real MOASS WILL occur:\n\n95% confidence interval: 02JAN2023-25FEB2023\n\n99% confidence interval: 22DEC2022 - 04MAR2023\n\n\nEvidence supporting my MOASS Timeline:\n\n1. GameStop continues to be overshorted; there are no indicators to suggest hedge funds will let up until it's financially practical for them to do so. They clearly have created a model, and a plan, to soon 'undo' their net short position. Key word: 'net')\n\n2. Similar to the final dip prior to the Volkswagen rip - there was a similar, last-chance, egregious 'overborrow' period.  This occurs when hedge funds realize that what is happening is inevitable: they then *overborrow* (which at a low rate and in a high inflationary environment, has worked wonders for them) and *overshort* (this not only improves their cost basis prior to the switch, but it allows them to have more control over the *timing* of the relatively instantaneous switch of their position from net short to net long)\n\n3. We are also months away from the economic limit where the new, natural demand would far exceed even any forged oversupply.  This too is well-timed with a falling general stock market, increases of VIX and VVIX, market-wide increases in VaR (value-at-risk) and volatility coefficients in the NSCC risk management algorithm, which elevate collateral deposit requirements.  This also plays into previous talks about the benefit of GME's negative beta during this coming scenario.\n\n4. Long term put expiry (hundreds of thousands of puts no longer available to balance their books. They too are aware of this)\n\n5. Q1, 2023 Depository (SLD) Requirement\n\n6. Verification and validation of cyclical quarterly SLD impact to GME's price (and volume), implying similarly-outsized green candles to occur on or around FEB2023 and continuing thereafter\n\n7. Evidence that, since GameStop's IPO, we have now hit a record number of red weeks in a row, serving as a statistical outlier, and therefore into oversold territory\n\n8. The vast majority of technical indicators are beginning to indicate 'oversold'.  Further, GameStop is now sufficiently cheaper than even 'official' analyst price targets.\n\n9. The 27-year old Truck Driver legal case (through FINRA), in which it was proven in federal court that the disabled-BUY-button by Robinhood (which, in collusion with Citadel, avoided Melvin's bankruptcy) on 28JAN2021 forced him into a $30,000 loss.  Now he'll be paid back by Robinhood.  This has already enabled a $3 Billion or so avalanche of federal litigation (class action) of retail against Robinhood and other brokerages via this avenue.  This supports a  new likelihood (higher likelihood than not) that BUY buttons will NOT be disabled going forward.  This gives a full green light to allow the natural, and necessary, MOASS to occur.\n\n10. The preponderance of the evidence proves that hedge funds have not closed their short positions, and have in 2021 until now, relied on the creation of several retail/meme ETFs, usage of total return swaps and bullet swaps, and tokenized crypto stocks. They were designed quite literally to be overshorted an order of magnitude beyond the shares outstanding. This too evidences that -  when this sum of shorts (and conservatively figuring for GME alone in those baskets) combined with the disclosed ORTEX short data, combined with Swaps / Brazil, combined with yet-to-be-discovered short interest, and considering our margin of error - GameStop is currently overshorted an order of magnitude above its outstanding shares.\n\n11. Wait for the moment when price is overshorted into adouble bottom.  That bottom could theoretically be in the $80 price range, yet its subject to change if there's a split.  Hedge funds would then need a controlled-inversion from a net short to a net long position, which is what will henceforth be known as the historic MOASS.\n\n12. They will risk their books like they did in 2021's year-end accounting\n\nNow and forever, this is not finra-certified financial advice\n\nTLDR; The real MOASS WILL occur: 95% confidence interval: 02JAN2023-25FEB2023. 99% confidence interval: 22DEC2022 - 04MAR2023.

Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford\u2019s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean\u2026 just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn\u2019t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.\n\nI would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She\u2019s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we\u2019re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.\n\n# New Leadership, New Vision\n\n**$11B Restructuring Plan**\n\nIn October of 2020, Ford hired its\u2019 new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company\u2019s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its\u2019 pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.\n\n**Trimming of Fat**\n\nFord has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.\n\nFord also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn\u2019t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.\n\nFord Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.\n\n**EV Investment**\n\nHere is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.\n\n**Revival of Valuable IP**\n\nIn the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They\u2019ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.\n\n# The Power of Partnerships\n\n**Ford, VW, and Argo**\n\nFord, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven\u2019t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.\n\n**Ford and Google**\n\nIn February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google\u2019s software and technology in all of Ford\u2019s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\\*cough\\* Toyota \\*cough\\*).\n\n**Ford and Rivian**\n\nFord made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO\u2019s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian\u2019s unique [\u201cskateboard\u201d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of \u201ca flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking\u201d on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.\n\nThe equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\\~$5B-7B) and now (\\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.\n\n# Financials and Valuation\n\n**Financial Overview**\n\n2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?\n\nDespite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don\u2019t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.\n\n**Dividend Reinstatement**\n\nGM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \\~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won\u2019t hurt either.\n\n**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**\n\nGenerally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford\u2019s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I\u2019m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren\u2019t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.\n\nQuick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:\n\nP/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)\n\nForward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)\n\nDebt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)\n\nPrice to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)\n\n|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|\n|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|\n|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|\n|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|\n|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I\u2019m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.\n\nCompared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford\u2019s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.\n\nMy personal price target: **$17.14/share**\n\n# 2021 Outlook\n\n**Massive Demand**\n\nFord\u2019s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer\u2019s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I\u2019ll list the Time to Turn for Ford\u2019s three new models in 2021 below:\n\n2021 Ford F-150: 9 days\n\n2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days\n\n2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)\n\nAs you can see Ford\u2019s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.\n\n**7500 tax credit availability**\n\nRemember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.\n\nThe way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla\u2019s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).\n\nBear Case\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they\u2019d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford\u2019s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.\n\n**Battery Supplier Issues**\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.\n\n**Debt Burden**\n\nThere\u2019s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn\u2019t due in the near future and Ford\u2019s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.\n\n**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**\n\nThis post has already become obscenely long so I\u2019m not going to go into great detail here. You\u2019ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford\u2019s path to success.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford\u2019s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford\u2019s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.\n\n*Disclosures: I am long Ford at an average cost basis of $10.30.

I have written many DD\u2019s about Direct Registering Shares including:\n\n* [Dispelling the FUD surrounding ComputerShare / Direct Registration System (DRS)](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p3owe8/dispelling_the_fud_surrounding_computershare/) (August 2021)\n* [Why I\u2019m moving my shares to Computershare](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ob0m9w/why_im_moving_my_shares_to_computershare/) (Opinion / June 2021)\n* [Gamestop Shareholder List - The Final Catalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nptiio/gamestop_shareholder_list_the_final_catalyst/) (June 2021)\n* [ComputerShare\u2019s Positive Price Impact and Tracking Batch Orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ptu49w/computershares_positive_price_impact_and_tracking/) (Sept 2021)\n\nI believe I have a good understanding about the Direct Registration System (DRS) and want to expand on the DD I had written previously. I believe despite DRS being widely discussed and popular there are still a few unanswered or unexplained questions that get brought up regularly due to confusion about DRS.\n\n**Lets talk about it.**\n\nI am aiming to answer the following commonly asked questions:\n\n* If DRS works, why is the price going down?\n* How does locking the float do anything?\n* How do you **know** it will do *anything*?\n\n## Compartmentalized Information\n\nI think we need a little bit of background information on how everything is laid out and how information is known by various parties in this whole market system. For this purpose I have prepared this graphic:\n\n[Compartmentalized information graphic](https://preview.redd.it/mtuezvbx1zp81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bcf498828bae8e46249da587b40213505cf1ecc)\n\n**DTCC** \\- The DTCC knows almost everything about what is going on. They are the *only* organization that has any awareness of how much shorting is going on, what is naked short, where the shorts are, who is failing to deliver\u2026 etc. This whole fraudulent system is completely facilitated by the DTCC. They have all the data, information and they let no one know anything.\n\n**Brokers** \\- They only know about their own client\u2019s holdings and what is available in public filings. They do not know what other brokers hold nor the whole extent of everything. All brokers combined may have more shares than outstanding, but as long as they are not aware of the other broker\u2019s holdings, they have no reason to believe anything is wrong.\n\n**Shorting Hedge Funds** \\- Likewise they do not have all the information about what is going on in the system. However they have developed ways to get information from Brokers and Companies to form a more complete picture. Using things like Payment for Order Flow they spend money intercepting data from Brokers. This gives them huge power to understand and know where things stand, where market sentiment is and how things are moving. They use planted consultants, hire former employees and other tactics to get a complete picture.\n\n**Shitty Consulting Groups** \\- They get hired by bad actors to get insider information, sway company decisions and then consultants ultimately get paid by Shorting Hedge Funds by hiring the consultants that have acted in the shorting hedge fund\u2019s best interests. Consultants are hired to consult on their consulting (provide insider information).\n\n**SEC** \\- They are supposed to be an oversight body, but they are purposefully kept in the dark about everything. They have limited power and due to revolving door policies their employees are not incentivized to do any work. They rely upon the required filings and whistleblowers to provide information, but their information and investigations are usually very delayed. If they find something it takes years to unwind it and ultimately leads to small insignificant fines.\n\n**Transfer Agent / Computershare** \\- They hold **the** book. The transfer agent holds the legal book outlining where the shares are and who they belong to. This book of ownership is the strongest legal form of ownership. If you have shares held on their book you are an owner of the company, full stop. They have extremely limited knowledge though of what is going on outside of their own book.\n\nThey know:\n\n* How many shares were issued.\n* Who owns them (direct registered, insiders, institutions) or are they beneficially owned by Cede & Co / DTCC.\n\nThat\u2019s about it. They have very very limited knowledge about who owns shares in the brokers. They do get some of this data once per year when they request *non-objecting beneficial owner* lists from the DTCC during annual shareholder meetings. This information is however, highly manipulated to prevent overvoting of shares.\n\nThe transfer agent knows how many shares are direct registered and the DTCC is also aware of this number. Brokers and Shorting Hedge Funds **do not** know how many shares are directly registered (more on this later, obviously).\n\n**The Company / GameStop** \\- They know what their transfer agent knows. Ultimately very little. Lots of people were asking why the company doesn\u2019t just come out and say their shares are being manipulated through naked shorting. They cannot make that claim, they do not have the evidence. The only people that know that for sure are the DTCC and the shorting hedge funds that engage in it.\n\nHopefully this paints a picture. Information is compartmentalized from everyone. It is a system purposefully built to keep information separated and non-public. That is why data providers make a lot of money to provide real time data. That is why a shorting hedge fund is willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for payment for order flow. It gives them the data they need to make money. If everyone had the data, no one would be able to manipulate the system.\n\n## Direct Share Registration happens in a vacuum.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many shares are direct registered. Only the DTCC, Transfer Agent and Company know how many shares are registered. The Brokers are in the dark. The Shorting Hedge Funds have limited knowledge. Even the SEC has virtually no idea.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the float is 1% locked or if it is 99% locked. The effect of direct registering is exactly the same, negligible. (Please keep reading).\n\nThat is why Direct Registration was not doing anything. That\u2019s why despite the best of efforts and intentions direct share registration was doing nothing. The price was sinking with even more aggressive shorting to try and play the narrative that direct registration does nothing. This was the FUD that has been pushed for the last 4-6 months:\n\n>If DRS works, why is the price going down?\n\n**ENTER GAMESTOP**\n\nThat was. Until GameStop filed form 10-Q on December 8, 2021 and included the following line:\n\n>As of October 30, 2021, 5.2 million shares of our Class A common stock were directly registered with our transfer agent, ComputerShare.\n\nSuddenly, everyone was aware of how many shares were direct registered. Filing the 10Q with the SEC created a factual known and public data point for the number of shares direct registered. There was suddenly no denying that shares were being direct registered.\n\nThe stock was however, still going down.\n\nThis is where we were met with the FUD:\n\n* If Direct Registering works, why is the price *still* going down?\n* It\u2019s only 5.2 million shares, it will never be enough.\n* You\u2019ll never hit 10 million shares, it will take years!\n\nThen GameStop filed form 10-K on March 17, 2022 with the following line:\n\n>As of January 29, 2022, 8.9 million shares of our Class A common stock were directly registered with our transfer agent, ComputerShare.\n\n**Boom.**\n\nSuddenly there were two very public and factual data points. This was enough for everyone in the dark to see how many direct registered shares there are and the trend and forecast for where these numbers are headed.\n\n* It allowed Short Hedge Funds to calculate how fucked they are.\n* It allowed the Brokers to calculate how many shares may exist outside of their own brokerage based on their own customer accounts and other trends.\n* It allowed the SEC to get an idea of who holds what shares based on the information in the public filings.\n\nDirect Registered Shares *would* not have done anything prior to being 100% registered, UNTIL GameStop released the numbers in their SEC filings. Now that everyone knows these numbers we suddenly see borrow rates going up, Brokers are suddenly more aware of how many shares are actually available. The claim that there was a good faith belief they could locate shares to short was suddenly growing narrower and narrower.\n\n**GAME ON**\n\nThanks to the efforts of /u/Roid_Rage_Smurf (DRSBOT), /u/jonpro03 ([Computershared.net](http://computershared.net/)) and /u/StopFuckingWithMe (CS Account High Scores) we now can calculate the number of direct registered shares to a high degree of accuracy. The current number is without a doubt, above 10M.\n\n# How do you know its going to do anything?\n\n## The Volkswagen Squeeze\n\nI absolutely hate that I am about to mention the Volkswagen squeeze. It is the *\u2018ole reliable\u2019* trope, *\u2018we\u2019re here\u2019*\u2026 but history does repeat. Let\u2019s take a quick cursory overview of what happened with Volkswagen.\n\n* Porsche purchased a 42.6% stake in Volkswagen.\n* They also purchased 31.5% in **ITM** call options totaling a combined ownership of 74.1%. (Yes, that 741).\n\nThis mere act of purchasing these shares and call options did not cause Volkswagen to squeeze, in fact it looks like the price dropped during the purchasing period. This purchase effectively happened in a vacuum, just like direct share registration. It was not until Porsche **announced publically** that they had acquired the high percentage of ownership that the shit hit the fan.\n\nWith public filings, it was known that Porsche effectively owned 74.1% and another institution owned 20%. At that exact moment everyone was publicly aware that the float was only \\~6%. Through other public filings, it was reported that the stock was 12.8% short. Since 12.8% is greater than 6% suddenly there was a rush on the stock. Short sellers calculated that they were fuk. This would not have happened had the data not been made public.\n\n## Side quest: Ryan Cohen and BBBY\n\nSimilarly Ryan Cohen buying 10% of BBBY did not cause the price to increase. The price actually was somewhat flat and even dropped around the times he purchased. It was not until he filed and announced publicly he had purchased that the price spiked.\n\n## Applying the same idea to GameStop.\n\nThrough filings and other data we know approximately how this may apply to GameStop. (I am using numbers from [Computershared.net](http://computershared.net/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Category|Shares|\n|:-|:-|\n|Issued Shares|76.3M|\n|Institutional|\\-13.7M|\n|Mutual Funds|\\-7.9M|\n|ETFs|\\-6.6M|\n|Insiders|\\-12.7M|\n|Direct Registered|\\-10.5M|\n|ITM Call Options|???|\n\nRemaining shares: \\~24.9M  \n\u201cReported\u201d Short shares: \\~15M (according to Ortex)\n\nRight now 15M < 24.9M shares so an immediate short squeeze isn\u2019t guaranteed. The odds of a squeeze however will increase more and more with one of the following things happening.\n\n* Direct register another \\~10M shares & report those direct registered shares in a public form with the SEC.\n* A large investor or institution buys \\~100K ITM call options and files their purchase publicly.\n* Institutions / insiders increase their positions by \\~10M shares and report their purchase publicly.\n* Short sellers increase their short position by 10M more shares OR the actual short numbers are revealed to be much higher to the public.\n\n**Again. The key to all of this is the information being made available publicly. Back room deals made in dark pools or even buying on lit markets will not do anything unless you can file and report that you are an owner of the stock. This is why institutions, holders of over 5% stock and GameStop reporting their direct registered numbers is so important and powerful.**\n\nIf there is a factual and known public data point showing that shorts exceed the remaining shares then everyone will be aware. All parties will know that the shorting hedgies r fuk and they will be exposed. There will be FOMO buying, there will be panic and the price will start to squeeze. Demand will exceed the supply.\n\nThis is a mathematical certainty.\n\n## Where does direct registering go from here?\n\n**Up. We go up.**\n\nIn the past \\~10 days or so we have seen a third wave in direct registration. We have also seen large positive sentiment on UUSB and an increase in YOLO options. Information on how to Direct Register has been spreading to more and more investors. Shout out to [https://www.drsgme.org/](https://www.drsgme.org/) and /u/millertime1216.\n\nI believe it is possible we could see a huge spike in direct registered shares and we could definitely add another 10M shares to the DRS count in the next 4-6 months.\n\nWave #1: DRS Finally Gains TractionWave #2: Fidelity accidentally says they have 10M shares to lend.Wave #3: Increased price action, new interest in stock (FOMO).\n\nHere is a graph thanks to [Computershared.net](http://computershared.net/):\n\n[DRS Graph from Computershare.net](https://preview.redd.it/5iu4w1ou1zp81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8460e6a5dfd5069c81ffee9a53917d91191af5)\n\nThis is a waiting game, MOASS is a certainty. DRS your shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\n**TL;DR:** Direct registering locks up shares so that the DTCC cannot touch them, but direct registration happens in a vacuum. All of the various parties are in the dark about the actual number of shares direct registered. That was until GameStop announced the direct registered numbers in their public filings. By doing this, it allowed every party to calculate the situation more accurately. We saw the borrow fee increase as a result. It can be shown that with public filings, stock movements can occur with the new information, such as what happened in the 2008 Volkswagen squeeze (old reliable). Direct registering shares is finally having a direct impact due to the publicly available information. Price increases, insider buy ins, FOMO, options and UUSB are all having an increase on direct share registration. MOASS is a mathematical certainty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOBLIGATORY. This is not financial advice. I may be wrong, please let me know if I have anything wrong in the comments below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT #1: I want to elaborate on something regarding the additional 10M shares DRS'ed to enter short squeeze territory. This assumes that no one, including institutions, insiders and mutual funds intend to sell. That's just my baseline where you start to threaten to squeeze through certainty. For even greater certainty, you would need to register the whole subsection of float, which is another 25M shares. This would lock all the floating shares, but would still leave the ability for insiders, institutions or mutual funds to sell which would hinder a squeeze.  You would then need to DRS an additional 15M shares (the number of shares sold short) to effectively lock in a squeeze and prevent it from being overly impacted by institutions, insiders and mutual funds.\n\nMy squeeze table would look something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|\\# of DRS Shares|Impact|\n|:-|:-|\n|10M|Increasing borrow rates. (We are here)|\n|20M|Float = Short shares (Squeeze territory)|\n|35M|Float = 0 (Zero liquidity)|\n|50M|Float = -15M (equal to 2x shares short)|\n\nOnce you start to hit that 35M level of shares DRS, you are eating into mutual funds and institution's shares. They will not allow that to continue and would hopefully have recalled any lent out shares well before that point.", "European Metals ($ERPNF) - Speculating on Europe\u2019s largest lithium resource.

Europe is the second largest EV market in the world, and recently [superseded China](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/012021-europe-overtakes-china-in-ev-sales-growth-in-2020#:~:text=London%20%E2%80%94%20Europe%20superseded%20China%20as,from%20EV%2Dvolumes.com.) as the \nglobal driver of electric car sales in 2020. The demand for lithium is a major bottle neck for battery manufacturers, and the demand is [expected to double](https://www.miningglobal.com/supply-chain-and-operations/global-lithium-demand-double-2024-driven-evs) by 2024. Based on this information, and that which follows, European Metals is a compelling long term speculation with the \npotential for significant returns. For these reasons, I am holding my main equity position for the foreseeable future. \n\n\n* **Short Term Trade**: European Metals is expected to announce an off-take agreement during Q1 of 2021. The EV and lithium industries are among the most popular \ninvestment and trading assets on the market. Lithium resource companies that are similar to European Metals, such as [$PLL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLL?p=PLL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) and [$LAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAC?p=LAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), have demonstrated significant price movement (280%-450%) after announcing off-take agreements or significant milestones.\nAs a result, it is expected that European Metals will experience a similar affect after it announces the first of many off-take agreements. For these reasons, I am temporarily increasing my position by a significant margin, with the plan to unload this portion of equity after a sharp increase in price and volume, following any major announcements. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n**CRITICAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n* **1.** European Metals operates the Cinovec Lithium Project, the largest lithium resource in Europe.\n* **2.** Estimated project life of 20+ years, with a minimum of 25,267 t/a lithium hydroxide or 22,500 t/a lithium carbonate annual production. \n* **3.** European Metals is partnered with, and funded by, [CEZ](https://www.cez.cz/en/home), a multibillion dollar, state-owned energy company.\n* **4.** On January 4th, 2021, European Metals [hired Lincoln Bloomfield](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/AN_1609760767084480500/european-metals-hires-lincoln-bloomfield-as-non-executive-director.aspx) as a non-executive director.

Their primary resource is the\nCinovec Lithium/Tin Project, Europe\u2019s largest hardrock lithium resource. It\u2019s located in the Czech Republic, approximately 100 km northwest of Prague, on the border of Germany, and central\nto several of the worlds leading EV and chemical manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes, Tesla, Volkswagen, BASF, Microvast, Northvolt, and BMZ Group. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**MANAGEMENT / LEADERSHIP / DIRECTORS**\n\nTo support a world class resource, European Metals is building a world class management team. \n\nEuropean Metals is lead by Executive Chairman, Keith Coughlan, a thirty year funds management veteran. In addition to his work at European Metals, \nMr. Coughlan has held director positions at oil, gas, and mineral exploration companies, such as [Calidus Resources](https://www.calidus.com.au/about/directors-management/), [Southern Hemisphere Mining](https://www.shmining.com.au/), and [Doriemus PLC](https://www.doriemus.co.uk/board-of-directors/). \n\nThe Executive Director, Richard Pavlik, is the former Chief Project Manager and Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer at [OKD](https://www.okd.cz/en),\na major coal producer in the Czech Republic. In addition, Mr. Pavlik served as a Project Analyst at Normandy Capital, and as Chief Engineer and \nHead of Surveying and Geology at [New World Resources](https://newworldres.com/)He holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Mining Engineering, and has over twenty five years of industry\nexperience in the Czech Republic. \n\nMetallurgical and geological departments are lead by consultants Grant Harman, and Dr. Pavel Reichl, both of whom have significant experience\nworking with lithium and mineral exploration companies, including Talison Lithium, UGL, SNC Lavalin, CleanTeq, Ausenco, and Newmont, the world\u2019s\nlargest gold mining company. \n\nOne of two recent and significant additions to European Metals include [Lincoln Bloomfield](https://www.stimson.org/ppl/lincoln-p-bloomfield-jr/), \nwho was appointed as a non-executive director. Mr. Bloomfield is an American diplomat, who has held policy positions in five previous administrations, including\nAssistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs, Special Representative of the President, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and Deputy Assistant to the Vice President for National\nSecurity Affairs. He is a cum laude graduate of Harvard College, and a vital asset to European Metals. \n\nThe second recent and significant addition to European Metals is Rodney Hooper, a veteran lithium consultant, who previously helped Piedmont secure their off-take agreement \nwith Tesla. Rodney regularly publishes information on key lithium battery issues [here](https://www.rkequity.com/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE CINOVEC LITHIUM RESOURCE?**\n\nThe project is located in the Krusne Hory Mountains, which stretch across the border between Czech Republic and the Saxony State of Germany.\nWith a history of successful mineral discoveries, this mining region dates back to the 1300s.

For example, The Volkswagen Group joined several other companies in recommending that its automotive brands, which include Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley and Porsche, pause their spending on Twitter out of concerns that their ads could appear alongside problematic content.\n\nMusk even acknowledged the plummet in ad revenue, tweeting on Friday morning that Twitter \u201chas had a massive drop in revenue,\u201d which he blamed on activist groups pressuring advertisers.\n\nI believe it's not the fault of \"Activists\" pressuring these companies to revoke or suspend their ad campaigns with Twitter, but in fact the fault of Musk for choosing to enact massive sweeping changes to Twitter creating an unstable product/platform. \n\nAdvertisers need stability in the platforms in order to effectively feel comfortable Advertising their products there. I would hope if I wanted to advertise my product, I could choose to not have it shown next to a tweet calling for far right/left extremist violence. That's awful for brand recognition. Overmoderation can definitely be bad, but under- or even no moderation can be equally bad. Abruptly removing 75% of your moderation team, whether the results end up being good or bad, is going to make others feel unstable with the platform.\n\nHell, you can even take it from the CEO of MMA, Lou Paskalis, that is one of the many large advertising groups leaving or suspending their ad campaigns with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LouPas/status/1588599808587345921);\n\n>Elon, Great chat yesterday, As you heard overwhelmingly from senior advertisers on the call, the issue concerning us all is content moderation and its impact on BRAND SAFETY/SUITABILITY. You say you\u2019re committed to moderation, but you just laid off 75% of the moderation team!\n\n>Advertisers are not being manipulated by activist groups, they are being compelled by established principles around the types of companies they can do business with. These principles include an assessment of the platforms commitment to brand safety and suitability.\n\n>That includes the trustworthiness of the leadership team and the behavior of the CEO. You claimed yesterday that you are deeply committed to Content Moderation, yet today you\u2019ve eliminated the vast majority of people who did that work for Twitter. How do we reconcile these?", "AMC DD for New Apes This is an updated repost and I\u2019m going to repost this until it gets to the top of the sub to reach more apes. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d [New post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/quoql9/endless_dd_about_amc_please_see_comments/).\n\n#TABLE OF CONTENTS: \n\n- Important Links for AMC Investors\n- Useful Links to Watch the Stock Market\n- Recommended Movies and Documentaries Related To Stock Market\n- All About AMC and Stock Market\n- Important DDs that Everyone Should Already Know By Now\n- Why Mainstream Media Isn\u2019t The Best Source of Information\n- All the Dirty Tricks and Market Manipulations\n- For New Apes Who Need Constant Reassurance\n- Picture Posts But They're Not A Meme\n- Selected Posts by Apes\n- Verified AMC DD Writers\n- Contribute To This Post\n- APE RULE #1 #2 #3 #4\n- Disclaimer[.](https://imgur.com/305M11P)\n\n#Important Links for AMC Retail Investors \n[Official AMC Corporate Information](https://www.amctheatres.com/corporate) \ud83c\udf7f\n\n[AMC Q2 2021 Earnings Q+A](https://app.saytechnologies.com/amc-2021-q2/) \ud83c\udf7f\n\n[AMC Press Release: Shareholder count](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Shareholder-Count/default.aspx) \ud83c\udf7f\n\n[AMC Investor Connect](https://www.amctheatres.com/stockholders) \ud83c\udf7f\n\n[AMC Historic National Ad Campaign](https://bit.ly/2X2cSxl) \ud83c\udf7f\n\n*Daily Update: Last mini update 03Sep2021.

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. \n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n[Gamestop Operating Loss per Year](https://preview.redd.it/4e698fbbneq61.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a7de50dda8fa00983cdec3285c1025a9ad83ca5)\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n \n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gamestop: Online Sales Growth by Year](https://preview.redd.it/rsvos30pneq61.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=2edf09bb5bd5d1de86557b06c28b938c4f3dcbd7)\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chewy Sales Growth by Year](https://preview.redd.it/apbjgr8vneq61.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e98cdc7f1b8503d4c5bfca053d4aebf058885a0)\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen. \n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2020 Online Electronics & Media Sales - Gamestop is orange](https://preview.redd.it/3vjkfrk2oeq61.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=eda46d2f6f87934f9bb93e606a414bfefd5cbb8c)\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it. \n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price-Sales Ratio 2020](https://preview.redd.it/3a9vif4boeq61.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf42d3b1e53472d42a4d8e70350c9ba91e5cfc3)\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023. \n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside. \n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aha - follow the crotch rocket](https://preview.redd.it/3pxbpp7koeq61.png?width=1299&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2f3a62a73eac63b2faee7cd7698e75dda3c8941)\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories.

Ape Strong.", "New study suggested that steel price shocks have a greater impact on Volkswagen, Daimler, and Toyota compared to US dollar and oil price shocks ", "New study suggested that steel price shocks have a greater impact on Volkswagen, Daimler, and Toyota compared to US dollar and oil price shocks ", "We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA) \\*\\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\\*\\*\n\nOver the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen\n\nDespite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3\u2019 2023.\n\nHowever, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla\u2019s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.\n\nTesla\u2019s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla\u2019s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla\u2019s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla\u2019s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla\u2019s current offerings as well as Tesla\u2019s future capabilities.\n\nThe Cybertruck further highlights Tesla\u2019s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla\u2019s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla\u2019s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, \"so off the hook, you can\u2019t even see the hook.\u201d EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck\u2019s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla\u2019s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that \u201cWe dug our own grave\u201d when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.", "We are Timeless Arctic, a five-year project about the human impact on the environment in Svalbard. Ask us anything! ** DEAR ALL; HOWEVER ADDICTIVE IT IS TO READ AND ANSWER YOUR COMMENTS, AFTER ALMOST 3,5 HRS WITH YOU, IT IS TIME FOR US TO GO! THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTERST IN OUR PROJECT. TUNE INTO OUR WEBSITE! **\n\nHi Reddit and fellow ice-lovers,\n\n\nWe are Frigga Kruse, Franziska Paul, and Linus M\u00fcller-Hillebrand of the [Timeless Arctic Project](http://timelessarctic.org) and we are part of the Timeless Arctic Project. Over the course of five years (2018-2023) we are assessing the impact humans had on Svalbard - a formerly pristine environment until it was discovered by European whale hunters.\n\n\nAlso in the team, we have a drone pilot, a scientific illustrator, a nature photographer and filmmaker, a specialist in plastic waste, a psychologist, a bacteriologist, and an archaeologist. \n\nThe project is funded by the [Volkswagen Foundation](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/foundation) as a Freigeist Project since 2018. That basically means that we've got a nice pot of money and can work on a project, which the foundation deemed to be inventive and original. In our case, we want to quantify the human presence and the commercial hunting in the formerly pristine ecosystem of Svalbard.\n\n\n**Frigga** is our team leader. She has a PhD in Arctic Archaeology, specilised in Svalbard (which she has visited many times), and this is her project. Svalbard was first documented by Willem Barents in 1596. Soon afterwards, Europeans voyaged to the North to hunt bowhead whales, polar bears, Atlantic walrus, Arctic foxes, and Svalbard reindeer. The populations of these \"Arctic Big Five\" got diminished to the point of almost-extinction. In the 20th century, protective measures were implemented in hopes of recovering the populations. Now Frigga wants to quantify the number of animals killed and study the human-animal-interactions of 420 years of Svalbard history.\n\n\n**Franziska** is doing her PhD in Archaeozoology.

Going back to the American Revolution and the many revolutions for a representative government that shook the globe and challenged the existing social systems and governments, the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution kickstarted modern theories of economics that have shaped capitalism and other systems ever since. The revolution's goals were driven by reason and science and the liberation and amelioration of all mankind. From the emancipation movement for Jews, Women, and Blacks to the abolition of monarchy, aristocracy, and social hierarchy, the revolutionaries also rejected any system of economics that allowed another great danger to enslave and oppress the people: Corporations.\n\nAll three primary texts of Classical Economics focus on barriers and restrictions that hinder commerce. What is less known or understood is the debates of the time concerning economics, especially the economic forces that shaped the American landscape leading up to the American Revolution. What is even less understood is the actual position of many founders and revolutionaries on economics. Many founders, including Paine, argued for free trade, limited government intervention, and the rights of individuals to pursue their own economic interests. What is not understood is that the founders considered \"limited government intervention\" to be absolutely necessary to prevent abuses and hindrances to internal commerce by corporations. Today, the corporate conservative movement represents no regulation or government intervention, and over the last many decades, it has deregulated those limited interventions and Anti-Trusts that were intended to prevent corporate abuses and ensure a fair competitive system. The Democratic-Republican founders recognized corporations as one of the greatest dangers to liberty and freedom.\n\nThe Tillman Act of 1907 was\u00a0a response to the widespread corruption and political influence of corporations in the early 20th century. Prior to the Act, corporations had been making significant contributions to political campaigns, often in exchange for favorable treatment and policies. Sound familiar?\n\nThe history goes back much further. The East India Company, a British trading company based in London,\u00a0played a significant role in shaping British colonial policy, which ultimately contributed to the tensions leading up to the American Revolution. The\u00a0Tea Act\u00a0of 1773, passed by the British Parliament on May 10, 1773,\u00a0granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the American colonies. This monopoly was achieved through several provisions; the Act allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to North America, bypassing colonial merchants and middlemen. The Act exempted the company from paying export duties/Taxes on tea shipped from Britain, reducing its costs and enabling it to undersell American businesses and smuggled tea. The Tea Act\u2019s monopoly provisions ultimately contributed to the escalation of colonial resistance, culminating in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, where colonists protested the tax and the monopoly by dumping tea into Boston Harbor. This event became a pivotal moment in the lead-up to the American Revolution.\n\nSeveral founders expressed concerns about the potential for corporate monopolies during the drafting of the United States Constitution.\u00a0Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, and the anti-federalists\u00a0argued for an anti-monopoly clause to be included in the Constitution. Six states wanted to incorporate provisions banning monopolies and granting special privileges into the Constitution. Thomas Paine explicitly discussed corporate monopolies in his works, particularly in \u201cThe Rights of Man\u201d.\u00a0He criticized the existence of chartered monopolies, which he saw as a barrier to individual freedom and a means of concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a few. In his draft of the Bill of Rights, Jefferson included an amendment that specifically addressed \u201cfreedom from monopolies in commerce.\u201d He believed that the government was responsible for preventing corporations from dominating entire industries, stifling competition, and exploiting consumers. Jefferson believed that the government had a role in regulating corporate power to prevent monopolies and promote competition.\n\nJefferson expressed concerns about the potential erosion of American democracy. He believed that the younger generation of Americans, who had not lived through the Revolutionary War and the country's founding principles, lacked the same feelings and principles of\u00a0liberty and independence\u00a0that characterized the original patriots of 1776. Jefferson feared that these younger recruits would be attracted to a more centralized, aristocratic form of government, founded on banking institutions and corporate interests. He warned that this would lead to a \u201csingle and splendid government\u201d that would \u201cride and rule over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry\u201d \u2013 the common people who worked the land.\n\n\u201cI hope that we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\u201d\n\nToday The top 1% of households hold 32% of national wealth, up from 23% in 1989. The richest 10% have seen a massive increase in their share of wealth, while the bottom half of households own only 1% of the wealth pie. The combined wealth of America\u2019s billionaires has grown by 88% over the past four years to $5.529 trillion. Meanwhile, the top 0.01% receive favorable tax treatment, advantages, and benefits, allowing them to accumulate vast wealth and monopolize and outcompete their smaller competitors. The conservative movement's resurgence, as well as its modern anti-intellectual ideology and policies, created the greatest accumulation of power and wealth in history in this New Gilded Age. The three wealthiest individuals in the United States hold more wealth than the bottom 50% of the US population, which is approximately 160 million people or 63 million households. The top 1% of Americans, comprising around 3 million people, have more wealth than the bottom 90%, which is approximately 291 million people. Today, the same forces that drove the past's anti-corporate and anti-monopoly revolutions are becoming more prevalent as Americans become more aware of the causes and dangers responsible for our current crony system. But how did we get here?\n\nStarting in the early 70s, \u201cThe Powell Memo\u201d was a blueprint for corporate domination of American democracy and a call to arms for corporations to actively involve themselves in politics. The Powell memo was the blueprint for the rise of the modern American conservative movement and the formation of influential right-wing think tanks and lobbying organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the American Legislative Exchange Council. The Powell Memo emphasized the importance of gaining control over the courts, stating that \u201cthe judiciary may be the most important movement for social, economic, and political change.\u201d Powell advocated for influencing higher education institutions, particularly law schools and business schools, to promote conservative economic and political ideologies and produce graduates supporting and perpetuating these views. The memo highlighted the need for corporate America to gain control over the media, including newspapers, magazines, and television, to shape public opinion and influence the narrative in favor of business interests. Powell\u2019s plan aimed to increase corporate influence over government institutions, including Congress, the Executive Branch, and state and local governments, to shape policies and regulations that benefit corporations.\n\nFollowing Powell, Robert H. Bork, a prominent antitrust scholar and Supreme Court nominee, advocated vigorously for a relaxation of antitrust enforcement in his 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox. Bork was influential in dismantling antitrust enforcement. With reduced antitrust scrutiny, large corporations engaged in mergers and acquisitions, leading to fewer competitors and reduced innovation. A relaxation of antitrust enforcement allowed dominant companies to exploit their market power, harming small businesses and consumers who rely on competition for better prices and services. Powell\u2019s memo also foreshadowed his court opinions, including First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, which furthered corporate interests and limited government regulation. The Bellotti decision significantly influenced the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Citizens United v. FEC (2010). In Bellotti,\u00a0the Court struck down a Massachusetts law prohibiting corporations from spending money to influence ballot initiatives and referendums.\n\nSince then, Monopolies have gobbled up local economies and centralized every industry in America in the name of lower prices and deregulation. Today, only a few Big Corporations control every industry in the United States. The top 1% of families captured 58% of total real income growth per family from 2009 to 2014. For 40 years before Reaganomics, the wealth of middle-class Americans was increasing faster than the top 1 percent. The nation went from localized, vibrant, independent economies with diversity in every industry, like beer brewing, for example, Milwaukee\u2019s finest, and you had to smuggle cores light out of Colorado. To chain stores nationwide with two corporations producing over 90% of all the beer consumed in the United States. In the Internet industry, just one company, Comcast, controls over 50 percent of the market. On Wall Street, the 20 biggest banks own assets equivalent to 84% of the United States' gross domestic product. Just 12 of those banks own 70% of all banking assets. That means if those 12 banks collapse, the entire system collapses. Just four companies control 90% of the grain trade. Three companies control 70% of the American beef industry. Four companies control 58 percent of the U.S. pork and chicken-producing processes. In retail, Walmart controls 1/4 of the entire U.S. grocery market. Four companies produce 75% of our breakfast cereal, 75% of all snack foods, 60% of all cookies, and half of all the ice cream sold in supermarkets nationwide. In health insurance, four companies control 3/4 of the entire market. In 38 states, just two insurers control 58% of the market. In 15 states, just one insurer controls over 60% of the market. In the cellular phone market, just four companies control 89% of the market. Capitalism can work for the average American and small businesses when the rules are fair. Rig those rules to give disproportionate power to corporations, and we have what Franklin Roosevelt called Fascism.\n\nFDR April 29, 1938, To the Congress. \"Unhappy events abroad have retaught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people.\n\nThe first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism\u2014ownership of Government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.\n\nThe second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.\n\nBoth lessons hit home.\n\nAmong us today, a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing.\n\nThis concentration is seriously impairing the economic effectiveness of private enterprise as a way of providing employment for labor and capital and as a way of assuring a more equitable distribution of income and earnings among the people of the nation as a whole.\"\n\nThe American Prospect reported that corporate concentration in the meatpacking industry has resulted in higher prices for consumers, with some estimates suggesting that Americans pay\u00a0up to 20%\u00a0more for meat products due to monopolistic practices. Corporate concentration leads to higher prices for essential goods and services. The production cost of insulin is estimated to be around\u00a0$6-10 per vial. However, manufacturers sell insulin to pharmacies and patients at much higher prices, often ranging from $300 to $1,000 per vial. The majority of insulin products are manufactured by only three companies: Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and Eli Lilly. This is what monopolies do because they can.\n\nThe rise of monopolies in the United States during the 1920s contributed significantly to the onset of the Great Depression. The Coolidge and Hoover administrations\u2019 relaxed anti-trust enforcement allowed corporate monopolies to form and expand, leading to increased market concentration and reduced competition.  As monopolies expanded, they eliminated smaller competitors, reducing market competition and stifling innovation.  With reduced competition, monopolies raised prices, reducing consumer purchasing power and increasing costs for businesses. This environment of concentrated wealth and reduced competition created vulnerabilities in the economy, making it more susceptible to shocks. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the already fragile system collapsed, leading to widespread unemployment, business failures, and a deepening economic depression.\n\nIn short, today, Americans have a propaganda-based history and view of the founders' economics and capitalism. The corporate versions of history and economics have all but completely erased America's actual history and the beginnings of classical and American economics. Jefferson expressed concerns about the consequences of enormous wealth inequality, stating that it produces misery for the bulk of mankind and that legislators should invent devices to subdivide property. He feared that great wealth disparities would threaten the nation, creating class differences that would overwhelm the shared commitment to the American republic's rights, responsibilities, and benefits. Thomas Jefferson introduced the concept of progressive taxation in the 1780s. James Madison\u00a0warned that inequality in property ownership would subvert liberty, either through opposition to wealth (a war of labor against capital) or \u201cby an oligarchy founded on corruption\u201d through which the wealthy dominate political decision-making. Sound familiar? \n\nPaine argued that inherited wealth and power were unjust and detrimental to society. He believed that individuals should not be born with advantages or disadvantages based on their social class or family background.                                                                                                                                                                     Paine advocated for social welfare measures, such as a guaranteed minimum income, education, and healthcare, to address poverty and economic inequality. He believed that these measures were essential for promoting individual freedom and happiness. Paine proposed a progressive tax system, where the wealthy were taxed at a higher rate than the poor. This would help reduce economic inequality and fund social welfare programs.\n\nThomas Paine\u2019s writings and ideas profoundly impacted the American Revolution and its aftermath. His influence extended far beyond the Revolution, shaping American democracy, liberal thought, and international politics. Historians and scholars recognize Thomas Paine as one of the most influential Founding Fathers.\n\nIn 1933, Roosevelt established the Antitrust Division within the Department of Justice, consolidating antitrust enforcement under a single agency.                                                                                                                            \u00a0FDR\u2019s initial approach was to use antitrust laws to break up monopolies and promote competition. He signed the Robinson-Patman Act (1936) and the Wheeler-Lea Act (1938), which prohibited unfair business practices and imposed stricter regulations on corporate mergers.                                                                           FDR\u2019s administration prioritized antitrust enforcement, filing numerous cases against large corporations, including Standard Oil, DuPont, and Alcoa.  Roosevelt\u2019s antitrust efforts targeted industrial concentration, aiming to promote competition and reduce market power. He believed that large corporations, particularly in the manufacturing and extractive industries, had become too dominant and stifled competition.                FDR\u2019s administration made extensive use of Section 7 of the Clayton Act (1914), which prohibits mergers and acquisitions that \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition\u201d or \u201ctend to create a monopoly.\u201d This provision was instrumental in challenging large mergers and acquisitions.                                                                                         The Antitrust Division successfully prosecuted several high-profile cases, leading to the divestiture or break-up of companies, such as: \\* Standard Oil (broken up into four companies: Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, and Texaco) \\* DuPont (forced to divest its General Motors stock) \\* Alcoa (required to divest its aluminum manufacturing assets)                                                                                                                                                                           FDR's efforts helped to reshape the American economy, laying the groundwork for economic growth and innovation in the post-war period, and the Greatest Prosperity in human history.\n\nFDR, I welcome their hatred.

Then something terrible happened\n\nSummary:  HBO\u2019s alleged role in a raging fire on the set of its miniseries \u201cI Know this Much is True,\u201d starring Mark Ruffalo, still upsets residents of a small New York town (Ellenville) who say they\u2019ve been neglected amid finger-pointing over the fire\u2019s cause. \n\nMeg James, Senior Entertainment Writer\nNov. 19\n\n\nELLENVILLE, N.Y. \u2014 Hollywood came to town, bringing bright lights, movie stars and a glint of glory.\n\nIn the foothills of the Catskill Mountains, Ellenville residents were thrilled when HBO began filming a Mark Ruffalo television series, \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\" in the village known in the region for its maximum-security state prison. A casting call for extras in nearby Poughkeepsie drew nearly 3,000. At Ellenville's hospital, doctors and nurses doubled as background actors.\n\nA Main Street landmark was spiffed up to depict a 1990s-era car dealership with gleaming props \u2014 Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes \u2014 on loan from car buffs throughout the state. Patriotic flags fluttered in the May breeze. \n\nBut after a long day of filming, a small fire began kindling inside the dealership about 2\u00bd hours after the last of HBO\u2019s crew had left for the night.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d recalled George Budd, Ellenville\u2019s assistant fire chief and the first firefighter on scene just before 1 a.m. \u201cI can still see it to this day. I bent over to put my bunker pants on, I stood up \u2026 and every window in the place just blew out. Then it became a hell show.\u201d \n\nThe May 9, 2019, blaze tore through the nearly 12,000-square-foot structure, burned for more than 12 hours and resulted in an estimated $15 million in property damage. No one was injured, but the disaster sparked finger-pointing, lawsuits and questions about accountability that still divide the small community in the Hudson River Valley. \nFive and a half years later, many in Ellenville remain bitter over HBO's alleged role in the fire and its aftermath. Small communities roll out the red carpet for filmmakers, but there's not always a happy Hollywood ending.\n\nUlster County fire investigators wrote in a report that equipment used by HBO caused the electrical fire, which they said ignited after crew members left sound equipment batteries charging overnight in the car dealership showroom. However, HBO for years blamed others for the start of the fire, although it did reach several confidential settlements, according to a Times review of fire reports, court filings and more than two dozen interviews.\n\nHBO has denied the allegations and said the damage was due to \"the negligence and/or culpable conduct of a third party\" over which they were not responsible. HBO blamed a faulty battery for causing the electrical fire. It sued the battery maker and settled the case earlier this year.\n\n\u201cHBO has been producing shows on location all around the globe for decades, always with the utmost care and respect for the local environment and community,\" the company said in a statement. \"It was no different for this series. The fire was an unforeseen accident, and it took time to investigate it thoroughly.\"\n\nEllenville officials estimated the fire wiped out more than two dozen jobs in the village of nearly 4,200 people about 90 miles north of New York City. \n\nTwo families \u2014 whose nearby mobile homes were damaged by the heat and the water used by firefighters \u2014 say they are still waiting for HBO to acknowledge their plight and are seeking compensation for their alleged damages. They have remained in their unsafe structures, saying they have no place to go.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy a home, you have big plans to make things nice,\u201d Pablo Ferrada Arias said one evening, as he stood outside his sage green and white trailer, its sides warped by the intense heat. \u201cBut they came to do the movie and destroyed everything.\u201d \n\nEllenville Police Chief Phil Mattracion said of HBO: \u201cThey moved on. 'Here today, gone tomorrow.' They have no vested interest in the town.\u201d\n\nFor five months, a location scout had traveled New York's back roads, searching for a car lot with just the right look. \n\n\u201cI saw it covered in snow, in the golden hour light, in all its 1950\u2019s atomic era glory,\u201d Sara Furey wrote in an Instagram post about her February 2019 discovery of the car dealership.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful old historic Midcentury Modern building,\u201d said Barbara Hoff, an Ellenville native who owns the local train depot and a vintage clothing and jewelry store. \u201cIt had been a car dealership forever \u2014 a landmark when you drove into town.\"\nBuilt in 1970, with glass walls and a semicircular showroom, the building was home to a Collier Motor Car dealership until 2009. But then General Motors slid into bankruptcy and abandoned franchise agreements, including in Ellenville. \n\nThe property sat vacant for years, a reminder of hard times gripping America's rural communities. Eventually, it was turned into a used car lot. HBO paid the business owner, 613 Automotive Group, $107,000 so the network could use the dealership for the film shoot.\n\nEager for new industries, New York politicians have embraced generous cash rebates to attract filmmakers who can turn their cinematic lens on lush landscapes and quaint neighborhoods.\n\nBut there\u2019s been a vigorous debate over New York's decision to steer $700 million a year to production companies. An audit in December found that taxpayers didn't get their money's worth \u2014 the state collected only 31 cents in tax benefit for every dollar it spent on rebates. Supporters of the film incentives try not to rock the boat and note the benefits to workers.\n\n\u201cWe don't like the word \u2018Hollywood\u2019 because it creates this myth that doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d said Laurent Rejt\u00f6, founder of the Hudson Valley Film Commission. \u201cMost of the people up here who work in the industry are blue-collar laborers.\u201d\n\n'This will happen': Mark Ruffalo moved mountains to make HBO's new Emmy hopeful\nHBO\u2019s production company, Calling Grace Productions, and the director of \u201cI Know This Much Is True\u201d hired local crews and extras for the nearly $90-million production that spent six months in 2019 filming throughout the Hudson River Valley.\n\nHBO received a $24-million state tax credit for the project, according to its New York tax certificate (the credits cover up to 40% of qualified costs).\n\nThose incentives helped bring Wally Lamb\u2019s 1998 bestselling book to life. Previous producers and screenwriters tried and failed to pare Lamb\u2019s 928-page novel into a movie about the dark and difficult lives of identical twins.\n\nRuffalo rescued the project, signing on as executive producer and star. HBO has long viewed Ruffalo (known to superhero fans as \"The Hulk\") as a marquee talent, and they agreed to make a six-part series. Ruffalo went on to win an Emmy Award in 2020 for his portrayal of both brothers: the hardened Dominick, who resents but also cherishes his softer twin, Thomas, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.\nRuffalo, during his acceptance speech, said the HBO series highlighted a larger question: \u201cHow are we going to deal and honor and take care of each other and our most vulnerable people?\u201d Ruffalo asked as he clutched his gold statuette. \"We do that with love, we do that with compassion. ... If we have privilege, we have to fight for those who are less fortunate.\u201d\n\nSixteen months earlier, Ruffalo and crew members had wrapped their second day of filming at Ellenville's dealership. Sound and location crew members were the last to leave, around 10 p.m.\n\nAfter midnight, security guard Joseph Perrone sat alone in the parking lot in his Jeep Wrangler, listening to the radio while sipping coffee. HBO crew members told Perrone to prevent looky-loos from touching the props \u2014 1990s-era Chevy muscle cars that ringed the dealership.\n\n\"What I heard was a 'pop.' I looked over my shoulder and seen an orange glow,\" Perrone said in an interview. \"From there it looked like fireballs flying from behind a desk and jumping onto a car. I don't mean like sparks, I mean full-on chunks of a flare.\"\n\nPerrone called 911. Firefighters were alerted at 12:56 a.m. Budd, the assistant fire chief, arrived within three minutes.\n\nThree wailing sirens rousted Jessica Rios Rodriguez from bed. Her mobile home lies just steps away from the former dealership building. She and her partner rushed their daughter to safety and alerted their neighbor, Ferrada.\n\nFirefighters raced to strap a hose on a hydrant but were foiled. \"The [expletive] hydrant won't open down here,\" bellowed one firefighter, according to a cellphone video.\n\nFirefighters tried two other hydrants but encountered weak water pressure. Additional firefighters were summoned from two counties. Eventually tanker trucks rumbled to scoop water from a nearby pond. By this time, the fire had spread to the mechanics' shop in the back. There, dozens of 55-gallon drums were stored, several containing waste oil. \n\nAs the oil ignited, huge explosions shook the site.\n\n\"Flames went 100 feet in the air, and I'm probably underestimating that,\" recalled Keith Hughes, a former Ulster County fire investigator. \"It was such a massive blaze.\"\nHBO-leased vehicles, including two rigs to power the set and film equipment, were parked in the back. They, too, caught fire. Rios' bedroom was less than 12 feet from one of the burning generator trucks.\n\nHer partner, Daniel Perez, turned their garden hose on burning embers swirling around their home but a firefighter took it to try to quell the inferno next door. \n\nNews of the fire quickly spread. Two friends, who'd loaned their classic Camaros to the production, made a beeline to Ellenville that morning.\n\n\"We pulled up and the fire was still going,\" said Kevin Leonard, who found his red Camaro IROC, which he'd first bought while in college, charred to a crisp. \"And there's some guy in a T-shirt just knocking down the building with an excavator. I was like: 'What the hell?'\"\n\nAt 1:47 p.m. \u2014 13 hours after it started \u2014 the fire was fully extinguished. \n\nBudd said he believes equipment brought in by HBO, including the generator truck, turned the fire into a fast-moving inferno. \n\n\"It was crazy, just crazy, how fast the fire went through that building,\" he said.\nHughes and a fellow Ulster County fire investigator zeroed in on the sound mixer's equipment cart left in a corner of the showroom as the possible \"origin\" of the blaze. \nThe cart had been loaded with sound electronics, battery charging stations, power strips, dozens of lithium ion batteries and coiled extension cords. It was parked a few feet from a pickup truck and a table with a space heater, coffee maker and Halloween decoration props, according to one investigator's report.\n\nRemains of 75 lithium ion batteries were found amid the rubble. There were other flammables, too: aerosol cans with tips blown off and two scorched gallon-sized cans that were presumed to contain paint thinner or some other solvent used by HBO crews to decorate the showroom, the report said.\n\nHughes believes an HBO crew member left batteries charging overnight in a receptacle plugged into a wall outlet.\n\nHBO crew members have testified they only used power from the generator truck, not from the dealership building, but Hughes points to a sizzled cord to counter that.\n\"They left the cart unattended, plugged in, charging batteries overnight,\" Hughes said in an interview, echoing deposition testimony he gave.\n\nThe material that sparked the blaze, fellow investigator David Thomas testified in a court deposition, was \"batteries and charging equipment, plugged into several power strips, plugged into an extension cord [that] was wrapped up on a cart ... plugged into the wall.\" \n\nThe county investigators reported the fire's cause as \"an unspecified electrical event,\" but in an interview Hughes said, \"It's HBO's fault, 100%.\" \n\nHBO denies it was at fault. \n\nThe New York company blamed a Torrance-based lithium ion battery company, whose lawyers pursued a theory that the blaze could have been intentionally set, court depositions show. There was no evidence of arson, the investigators said. \nLawyer Wayne Lonstein, who has sued HBO on behalf of the families, suggested the fire may have been sparked by cigarettes Ruffalo was smoking for a scene several hours earlier, but HBO attorneys rejected the smoking conjecture, citing video of Ruffalo's smoking scenes. \n\n\u201cThe footage closest in time to when the fire occurred is still four and a half hours prior to the start of the fire,\" HBO lawyer Steven Montgomery wrote in a court filing. The judge denied Lonstein's efforts to target Ruffalo.\n\nSecurity video from a nightclub across the highway showed the fire had burned undetected for at least eight minutes before Perrone discovered it, prompting an allegation by HBO's fire investigator that Perrone may have been sleeping on the job.\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s what the fire inspector that HBO hired told me,\u201d location manager Stephen Grivno wrote a fellow crew member in a text message viewed by The Times. \u201cBut I don\u2019t honestly know if he was like starting a rumor or what. .. It seemed like [the private investigator] was hired by HBO to cast suspicion on everybody else.\"\nPerrone has denied the allegations. \n\n\"I'm nobody's scapegoat,\" Perrone said. \"I did nothing wrong, but some jerk decided to point a finger of speculation at me. From Day One, the finger pointing started \u2014 trying to avoid responsibility for the fire.\" \n\nThat summer, Perrone stopped getting security jobs.\n\nThe day after the fire, HBO's insurance adjuster clashed with village officials over the preservation of evidence.\n\nHBO's adjuster, Crawford & Co., took Ellenville officials to task, saying they \u201cobserved individuals compromising the integrity of the fire scene... [including] a worker in an excavator destroying the particular area where the fire is believed to have originated by displacing debris,\u201d according to Ellenville documents provided to The Times. \n\nEllenville officials countered that they hadn't ordered heavy equipment but the building owner did, according to a witness statement included in an insurance company report. \n\nThen-building inspector Brian Schug responded that village personnel made \"every realistic effort\" to protect the public and firefighters.\n\nHBO's \"carelessness destroyed a Village landmark and left nearly 30 people unemployed,\" he wrote in an email to Crawford & Co. and HBO's insurance company, Allianz.\n\nDisputes over who was responsible delayed cleanup of a huge mound of fire debris fouled with toxic waste. \n\n\"It's a very hard thing for a small community to have a trauma like that,\" said Steven L. Kelley, Ellenville Regional Hospital chief executive. \"And there was this pile of rubble still sitting there for about a year \u2014 reminding us how bad [the fire] was.\" \n\nThe debris pile \u2014 twisted metal, charred concrete, car frames and blown-out oil tanks \u2014 was a suspected source of toxins. The landowner installed a chain-link fence around it. Initially, the site was preserved for inspection by insurance experts. But in late 2019, Ellenville officials cited the property owner, 613 Automotive, for failing to clean up the pile, which contained \"oil, gasoline and asbestos\" and other contaminants, according to the citation.\n\nLocal politicians didn't help. A council meeting turned testy nine months after the fire when Lonstein and residents \u2014 including Rios and Ferrada \u2014 pleaded with village leaders to help resolve the potential health threat. That same month, contamination was still present on the site, according to a February 2020 New York spill report. \nA state inspector was called when an oil sheen developed in standing water after a heavy rain. \n\nStorm runoff drained down a shallow slope and into Rios\u2019 backyard, the state report noted. It was possibly laced with toxic chemicals, including residue from the firefighting foam, which contains harmful chemicals known as PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances), the report said. After the fire, Rios said, her chickens died. So did the tree by their front door.\n\n\"Here you had a situation in which HBO turns its back on the owners of the property,\u201d former Mayor Jeffrey Kaplan and an attorney for 613 Automotive said in defense of his client during the heated 2020 council meeting.\n\n\u201cThe fire was devastating to Ellenville,\u201d Rejt\u00f6, founder of the Hudson Valley Film Commission, said. \u201cIt created a lot of bickering and infighting between different people and the mayor \u2014 just the politics of it all.\"\n\nRios' mobile home with baby blue siding had been her American dream. \nThe 37-year-old Puerto Rico native worked two jobs, including as a teacher's assistant, to save money to buy the trailer for $20,000 in 2016 with her partner. The fire's intense heat melted and warped the siding and caused structural damage. Asphalt shingles liquefied, dripping tar stains down a back wall. Clothes, furniture and other possessions were ruined by the heavy smoke. \n\nWater firefighters sprayed over Rios' and Ferrada's homes caused further structural damage, and mold now seeps through the ceilings and walls, according to a negligence lawsuit the families filed against HBO.\n\nIn Ferrada's home, the ceiling sags, the walls buckle and floor vents are rusted. A portion of an exterior wall peeled away, and rooms tested positive for mold. He stretched thick plastic to seal off the worst bedroom, but the air is heavy, making it difficult to breathe inside.\n\nFerrada's daughter, who was 7 when the fire struck, used to live with him part time but developed asthma. Now, she stays with her mom.\n\nHe has a range of health issues, including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, problems with his esophagus and depression. Blood tests have shown high levels of metals in his system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired \u2014 very tired,\u201d Ferrada, a 46-year-old Chile native, said. \u201cI lost too much here: I lost money, lost time with my daughter\u2026 I lost everything.\u201d\n\nA cardiologist expressed concern for Ferrada's health: \"Simply put you need to get out of there,\" Dr. Jack Wolfson wrote in an October report. \"It is more than dangerous, it's deadly. You are being poisoned.\"\n\nThe former Ellenville building inspector, Schug, had issued a \"do not enter\" order for the dealership and homes. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d Schug said during the contentious 2020 council meeting, adding the homes were not \u201csafe.\u201d\n\nThe property owner, 613 Automotive, initiated eviction proceedings against the families after they stopped paying land rent after the fire because of the property damage and contaminants. The trailers (which the families own) are too old and damaged to be moved.\n\n\"We have no place to go,\" Rios said. \n\nLonstein, a municipal judge and attorney whose family owns an office building south of the fire site, became involved soon after the fire when some of his employees complained of coughs and other ailments. He ordered environmental tests that showed the presence of asbestos, lead, barium and cadmium, among other toxins.\nHe became increasingly alarmed after seeing Ferrada's young daughter play in the snow near the debris pile months after the fire. As he dug into the case, he became angry after learning that the families had received no assistance.\n\n\"It comes down to this: If you hurt people, you take care of them,\" Lonstein said in an interview.\n\nTrying to find a resolution more than a year after the fire, Lonstein reached out to then-state Sen. Jen Metzger, who champions environmental causes embraced by Ruffalo, who lives in a nearby county. \n\nSix months after the fire, Ruffalo had testified in Congress about the need to force companies to pay for health issues stemming from the spread of PFAS chemicals. \nMetzger traveled to Ellenville to meet with Ferrada and Rios in their blistered homes. The visit came a few days after Ruffalo won his Emmy for \u201cI Know This Much Is True.\"\n\nMetzger had held a campaign fundraiser, headlined by Ruffalo, that month. He contributed $1,500, records show. She and her staff hoped they could enlist Ruffalo's help in getting HBO's attention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad situation,\u201d Metzger wrote a few weeks later in an email sent to an environmental activist who works with Ruffalo. Metzger\u2019s message summarized her and a staff member's visit to Ellenville.\n\n\"HBO, [alleged] perpetrators of the fire, left their mess for others to clean up,\u201d Max Cordella, the staff member, wrote. The two families had young daughters and needed help, Cordella said, because \"their trailers are still not in livable condition but the families have no options so [they] remain.\"\n\nCordella this month confirmed the Ruffalo outreach efforts. Metzger's staff first contacted HBO but network executives \"stopped responding,\" Cordella said. \"We were trying to help and thought that we may be able to get [the families' situation] on this sympathetic movie star's radar.\"\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" Lonstein said. \n\nIn an interview, Metzger \u2014 who now is Ulster County executive \u2014 expressed frustration at the ongoing plight of the families.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money made off this film compared to the relative cost of doing the right thing is virtually meaningless to a company the size of HBO,\" Metzger said. \"People\u2019s lives are at stake and that\u2019s really all that matters.\u201d\n\nA representative for Ruffalo declined to comment. \"We empathize with anyone impacted and hope the matter resolves soon,\u201d HBO said in its statement.\nSeveral others who lost classic cars and equipment trucks said they struggled for months \u2014 and years \u2014 for compensation. \n\n\"I never got reimbursed from HBO or Calling Grace,\" said Rich Shakerley, who lost his silver Camaro. He instead filed a claim against his own insurance policy. \nDavid Haddad, who owns a production equipment company, said he lost sleep for about a year amid his battle with HBO and its insurance company to cover the loss of his camera truck. \"HBO and their insurance provider went out of their way to handle this poorly,\" Haddad said. \n\nCalling Grace and its insurance company blamed Torrance-based IDX System Technology, which manufactured some of the lithium ion batteries, alleging the batteries malfunctioned \u2014 an allegation that IDX has denied.\n\nCalling Grace sued IDX in 2021, saying it sustained losses of $1.9 million and its insurance policies had paid others \"in excess of $3.5 million for damages resulting from the fire.\" \n\nEarlier this year, HBO and its insurance companies settled claims with various parties, including the property owner, 613 Automotive Group. \nHBO noted in its statement that the only remaining lawsuit is the one brought by the two families.\n\n\u201cAll of this is a nightmare,\u201d said Rios. \u201cAfter the fire, people didn\u2019t believe that we were living here \u2014 that we are still living here.\u201d\n\nIn May 2022, Lonstein sued Ruffalo, HBO and 613 Automotive on behalf of the families seeking at least $2 million in damages. He also demanded that HBO provide a trust fund to cover their medical expenses for their \"increased risk of bodily injury due to this incident.\u201d \n\nHBO's attorneys made settlement offers that were rejected by the families. The company is now seeking to dismiss the case, saying the \"plaintiffs have offered no proof that HBO and Calling Grace were responsible for exposing them to toxins that caused them damage.\"\n\nA trial has been scheduled for early next year. \n\n\"They came here to film and everything was nice, but they didn't think about the consequences,\" Rios said in a recent interview. \"We are the consequences. HBO doesn't care, 613 Automotive doesn't care, Mark Ruffalo doesn't care, but this is about our health, our lives and our house. Somebody has to be responsible and that's why we are still fighting.\"\n", "[Available] Google Drive PDF books thread (part-10)!+ Accepting requests every day * **If you find your book in the thread below, send the book number via Reddit chat**\n* **all books have the latest version as well in multiple editions**\n* **Books (pdf) sent via Google -Drive link**\n* **UPVote this\u00a0post if you find it useful**\n\nPlease find the list below\n\n6287.

Excludes: > Future cash charges or reserves. > Past cash charges or losses. > Write-downs of accounts receivable. > Deferred Revenue Addback: Adjustments for recognized deferred revenue. > Non-Recurring Fees: Cash payments related to the agreement, loan documents, and PWI Purchase Transaction (up to $1.9 million if incurred by January 1, 2021). > Non-Recurring and Extraordinary Losses: As approved by the lender. > Integration Costs for PWI Purchase Transaction: IT and accounting expenses up to $200,000 (if incurred within 12 months of the closing date).\n\n**Special Conditions:**\u00a0Contingent Commission Income: Only included in net income if: > Actually received in cash. > Confirmed as payable in writing or electronically and due within 90 days.\n\n**EBITDA Run Rate:**\u00a0This metric is not intended to be guidance by management regarding the future earnings of the Company; rather, it is intended to capture the twelve-month earnings of what the Company currently owns or has recently acquired; as such, it includes: The actual operating results of our Extended Warranty businesses for the prior twelve months > The investment income associated with our Extended Warranty float, adjusted to reflect expected higher rollover reinvestment earnings associated with the current interest rate environment > KSX twelve months actual results, adjusted for: > Last twelve months of results for SPI and DDI, based on actual and our QofE due diligence.\n\nThe company utilizes the EBITDA Run Rate as a proxy for free cash flow because it provides a clearer view of earnings potential without the distorting impact of taxes. The company\u2019s operations are intentionally asset-light, targeting only asset-light businesses, which significantly reduces maintenance capex requirements. As a result, EBITDA aligns more closely with free cash flow compared to typical businesses. Additionally, the company benefits from significant net operating losses (NOLs) stemming from challenges under prior management, which effectively minimize its taxable income. These NOLs reduce or eliminate the need to allocate cash for taxes, further aligning EBITDA with free cash flow during periods when these tax benefits are available.

To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday,*\u00a0[*sign up here*](https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/climate-energy-the-spark/)*.*\n\nI\u2019ve thought more about gallium and germanium over the last week than I ever have before (and probably more than anyone ever should).\n\nAs you may already know,\u00a0[China banned the export of those materials to the US last week](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/06/1108020/what-chinas-critical-mineral-ban-means-for-the-us/)\u00a0and placed restrictions on others. The move is just the latest drama in escalating trade tensions between the two countries.\n\nWhile the new export bans could have significant economic consequences, this might be only the beginning. China is a powerhouse, and not just in those niche materials\u2014it\u2019s also a juggernaut in clean energy, and particularly in battery supply chains. So what comes next could have significant consequences for EVs and climate action more broadly.\n\nA super-quick catch-up on the news here: The Biden administration recently restricted exports of chips and other technology that could help China develop advanced semiconductors. Also, president-elect Donald Trump\u00a0[has floated all sorts of tariffs](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/25/1107224/how-trumps-tariffs-could-drive-up-the-cost-of-batteries-evs-and-more/)\u00a0on Chinese goods.\n\nApparently in response to some or all of this, China banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials used in manufacturing, and said it may further restrict graphite sales. The materials are all used for both military and civilian technologies, and significantly, gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors.\n\nIt\u2019s a ramp-up from last July,\u00a0[when China placed restrictions on gallium and germanium exports](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/10/1076025/china-export-control-semiconductor-material/)\u00a0after enduring years of restrictions by the US and its Western allies on cutting-edge technology. (For more on the details of China\u2019s most recent move, including potential economic impacts, check out the\u00a0[full coverage from my colleague James Temple](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/06/1108020/what-chinas-critical-mineral-ban-means-for-the-us/).)\n\n**What struck me about this news is that this could be only the beginning, because China is central to many of the supply chains snaking around the globe.**\n\nThis is no accident\u2014take gallium as an example. The metal is a by-product of aluminum production from bauxite ore. China, as the world\u2019s largest aluminum producer, certainly has a leg up to be a major player in the niche material. But other countries could produce gallium, and I\u2019m sure more will. China has a head start because it\u00a0[invested in gallium separation and refining technologies](https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12).\n\nA similar situation exists in the battery world. China is a dominant player all over the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries\u2014not because it happens to have the right metals on its shores (it doesn\u2019t), but because it\u2019s invested in extraction and processing technologies.\n\nTake lithium, a crucial component in those batteries. China has around\u00a0[8% of the world\u2019s lithium reserves](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-could-a-us-china-trade-war-mean-for-the-energy-transition/)\u00a0but processes about 58% percent of the world\u2019s lithium supply. The situation is similar for other key battery metals. Nickel that\u2019s mined in Indonesia goes to China for processing, and the same goes for cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOver the past two decades,\u00a0[China has thrown money, resources, and policy behind electric vehicles](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/21/1068880/how-did-china-dominate-electric-cars-policy/). Now China leads the world in EV registrations, many of the largest EV makers are Chinese companies, and the country is home to a huge chunk of the supply chain for the vehicles and their batteries.\n\n**As the world begins a shift toward technologies like EVs, it\u2019s becoming clear just how dominant China\u2019s position is in many of the materials crucial to building that tech.**\n\nLithium prices have dropped by 80% over the past year, and while part of the reason is a slowdown in EV demand, another part is that China is oversupplying lithium,\u00a0[according to US officials](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-is-oversupplying-lithium-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says-2024-10-08/). By flooding the market and causing prices to drop, China could make it tougher for other lithium processors to justify sticking around in the business.\n\nThe new graphite controls from China could wind up affecting battery markets, too. Graphite is crucial for lithium-ion batteries, which use the material in their anodes. It\u2019s still not clear whether the new bans will affect battery materials or just higher-purity material that\u2019s used in military applications,\u00a0[according to reporting from Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-could-a-us-china-trade-war-mean-for-the-energy-transition/).\n\nTo this point, China hasn\u2019t specifically banned exports of key battery materials, and it\u2019s not clear exactly how far the country would go. Global trade politics are delicate and complicated, and any move that China makes in battery supply chains could wind up coming back to hurt the country\u2019s economy.\u00a0\n\nBut we could be entering into a new era of material politics. Further restrictions on graphite, or moves that affect lithium, nickel, or copper, could have major ripple effects around the world for climate technology, because batteries are key not only for electric vehicles, but increasingly for our power grids.\u00a0\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that tensions are escalating, it\u2019s still unclear what\u2019s going to happen next. The vibes, at best, are uncertain, and this sort of uncertainty is exactly why so many folks in technology are so focused on how to diversify global supply chains. Otherwise, we may find out just how tangled those supply chains really are, and what happens when you yank on threads that run through the center of them.\u00a0\n\n# DEC. 12th 2024~EU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chains\n\n[EU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chains - European Commission](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-and-us-host-minerals-security-partnership-forum-workshop-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-12_en)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eq8pp1a1h6e1.png?width=291&format=png&auto=webp&s=392dd7fa694eb9fcbfe0b3e8d1c7933361f00831\n\nToday, the EU, the United States and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) participated in a workshop on public-private Investment in critical minerals. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nToday, the EU, the US and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) took part in a workshop titled 'Public-Private Investment in Critical Minerals Focusing on Developing a Positive, Trade-Friendly Local Value Addition Agenda in Producing Countries'.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThis was the first in a series of workshops that will be organised under the MSP Forum. The workshop took place in Brussels during the 2024 edition of\u00a0[Raw Materials Week](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/week_en). Participants discussed three key issues: the challenges facing investors, government policies aimed at fostering the development of the critical raw materials sector, and ways to mobilise investment to increase local value addition.\u00a0\n\nFostering investment in critical raw materials and creating sustainable local value addition for resource-rich countries is a key facet of the MSP Forum. Participants from financial institutions highlighted the importance of de-risking the investment climate to facilitate more investment, while government representatives outlined how successful policy initiatives can support greater development of the critical raw materials sector. Finally, representatives from civil society provided valuable insights into the inclusion of local communities, and the importance of upholding the highest possible sustainability standards and mitigating environmental and social risks in critical material projects.\u00a0\n\n# Next steps\n\nThe MSP Forum will convene another workshop on environmental, social and governance standards during the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town in February 2025.\u00a0\n\n# Background\n\nThe MSP Forum builds on the EU\u2019s Critical Raw Materials Package adopted in March 2023, which emphasised the need for more diverse and more sustainable critical raw materials (CRM) supply chains through new international mutually supportive partnerships, such as the CRM Club. The MSP consists of 15 partners, who are automatic members of the MSP Forum (Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and the EU), alongside 15 new MSP Forum members (Argentina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Namibia, Peru, the Philippines, Serbia, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia).\n\nCRMs are indispensable for a wide range of technologies needed for EU strategic sectors such as the net-zero industry, digital, energy, transportation, space and defence. While demand for these critical raw materials has never been higher, the supply of CRMs faces increasing geopolitical, environmental, and social risks, highlighting the need for greater cooperation between like-minded international partners to secure and diversify CRM supply chains.\u00a0\n\n# DEC. 12th 2024~Joint Statement on the High-Level Minerals Security Partnership Forum Events in Brussels\n\n[Joint Statement on the High-Level Minerals Security Partnership Forum Events in Brussels - United States Department of State](https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-the-high-level-minerals-security-partnership-forum-events-in-brussels/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90m1z23m0h6e1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb6ec002dfed2c90aa212360c17d6dd2482ce69\n\nOn December 12 in Brussels, the European Commission hosted during its Raw Materials Week, a meeting of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Principals that focused on specific projects as part of the Forum\u2019s Project Group and a workshop on local value addition as part of the Forum\u2019s Policy Dialogue Group. \u00a0These meetings were co-chaired and hosted by Kim Jin-dong, Director General for Bilateral Economic Affairs of ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jose W. Fernandez, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and Kerstin Jorna, Director General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship, and SMEs at the European Commission.\n\nThe Principals meeting, led by the Republic of Korea and the United States, convened government officials and private sector investors and focused on advancing and accelerating MSP projects on rare earth elements,\u00a0as well as identifying new responsible mining, processing, and recycling projects for critical minerals in MSP Forum member jurisdictions.\n\nAt the ROK-led MSP Project Deep Dive meeting, participants discussed the challenges to developing specific MSP projects, including HyProMag\u2019s rare earth elements recycling project in the UK, Germany and the US, and the newly added Arafura Rare Earths\u2019 Nolans Project in Australia, and identified means to advance these projects.\u00a0 Additionally, the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) provided a briefing on its REEs recycling technology and ongoing projects.\n\nAt the MSP Forum\u2019s Project Group meeting, participants took note of the recent presentations from the governments and private sector of MSP Forum members Argentina and Greenland and appreciated the exchange on specific critical mineral projects and investment opportunities in their countries.\u00a0 MSP Forum members will continue to make individual country presentations on specific projects to MSP Partners and the MSP Finance Network over the next several weeks and months in partnership with the Minerals Investment Network for Vital Energy Security and Transition (MINVEST).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe workshop on local value addition, led by the European Commission, will be the first of a series of events that will take place as part of the Policy Dialogue component of the MSP Forum.\u00a0 The workshop consisted of three sessions on various topics, including investment challenges for investors in critical mineral value chains, government policies focused on local value addition, and examples of how to mobilize investments for local value addition.\n\nThe MSP looks forward to hosting MSP Forum members for the next MSP Forum event on the margins of Mining Indaba in Cape Town, South Africa on 4 February 2025.\n\n\n\n# DEC. 11th 2024~ Critical Mineral Policy Working Group Unveils Bipartisan Legislation, Policy Report\n\n[Critical Mineral Policy Working Group Unveils Bipartisan Legislation, Policy Report | Select Committee on the CCP](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/critical-mineral-policy-working-group-unveils-bipartisan-legislation-policy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxdfl1pv1h6e1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=478cf91e00e06a8bb351906ef2d3e37314cf1679\n\n**WASHINGTON, D.C.--**\u00a0Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party joined Rep.

Wittman.**\u00a0*\u201cAs lead of the Select Committee\u2019s Critical Minerals Policy Working Group, I\u2019ve spent the past few months convening roundtables with experts to inform Congress on securing our critical mineral supply chains. We have worked to generate proposals to reduce China\u2019s dominance, which has run unchecked for far too long. Their product dumping, escalatory export controls, destructive environmental practices, and forced labor abuses must not be tolerated. I\u2019m proud of these comprehensive pieces of legislation that will remove unnecessary export controls on key critical minerals and improve scientific and technical cooperation in the earth sciences with allied foreign countries. These bills will help us fundamentally reset the United States\u2019 economic and technological competition with China.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cAmerica\u2019s dependence on adversarial nations for critical minerals poses a significant threat to our national security and our clean energy future,\u201d*\u00a0***said Rep.

Together, these initiatives reflect our commitment to national security and economic resilience,\"*\u00a0**said Rep. Torres.**\n\nThe\u00a0[**report**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Critical%20Minerals%20Report%20Cover%20%281%29-merged%20%281%29.pdf)\u00a0outlines the rationale for creating the Policy Working Group, summarizes the working group\u2019s meetings, and recommends legislation to address critical mineral supply chain vulnerabilities. The report also highlights bipartisan legislation introduced by members of the House and Senate that would improve supply chain resilience.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[**The Earth Sciences and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/WITTMA_117_xml.pdf)\n\n\u00a0\n\n* The\u00a0*Earth Sciences and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024*\u00a0authorizes and appropriates funds for the Secretary of the Interior to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with foreign governments to facilitate collaboration on earth sciences and critical mineral supply chains. These agreements encourage cooperation with foreign government and private sector entities, to advance geologic mapping, mineral resource assessment, data analysis, and training in environmental and workplace standards. MOUs also facilitate partnerships between U.S. entities, including government agencies, universities, and private companies, with their foreign counterparts. The Act emphasizes collaboration with partner countries that are strategic allies or critical mineral sources, fostering sustainable development and supply chain security.\n* The Act authorizes $3 million for fiscal year 2025, requiring funding to directly advance MOUs. Remaining funds may be used for critical mineral data collection and shared data management initiatives with partner countries. Additionally, the Act encourages broader participation from scientists, international organizations, and other stakeholders. By leveraging international cooperation and geoscientific expertise, the Act aims to enhance the United States\u2019 ability to manage critical mineral resources, improve supply chain resiliency, and reduce reliance on foreign adversaries for essential materials.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[**Amendment to the Export Reform Control Act of 2018**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/WITTMA_118_xml.pdf)\n\n\u00a0\n\n* The proposed bill amends the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to implement export controls on black mass (recycled lithium-ion battery material) and swarf (magnet manufacturing byproducts) to prevent exploitation by foreign adversaries, particularly the PRC. The bill aims to strengthen domestic critical mineral supply chains, support battery recycling and processing industries, and counter PRC market manipulation.\n* Under the legislation, a license will be required for the export, re-export, or in-country transfer of black mass and swarf if the end-user is a foreign adversary or related entity. Applications for these licenses would be denied to foreign adversaries, including PRC entities with direct or indirect government, military, or CCP influence.\n* The bill seeks to facilitate the sustainable recycling and recovery of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from spent batteries; enhance U.S. processing capabilities; and limit adversarial control over essential materials. By restricting exports of recyclable materials containing critical minerals, the legislation seeks to bolster U.S. industries and reduce reliance on adversarial nations for strategically significant resources.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[**Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/TORRNY_210_xml.pdf)\n\n\u00a0\n\n* The Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act aims to strengthen the U.S. workforce in mining, refining, processing, and recycling critical minerals by amending key education and workforce laws. The bill introduces a national interest waiver under the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow foreign engineers specializing in critical minerals to work full-time in the U.S. for businesses or government agencies, fostering domestic expertise in critical mineral production and recycling.\n* Additionally, the bill amends the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 to promote international educational exchanges focused on critical minerals. It enables U.S. citizens to study abroad at specialized institutions and facilitates enrollment of foreign students in U.S. programs related to critical minerals. The legislation encourages educational partnerships, research collaborations, joint degree programs, and training initiatives between U.S. and foreign institutions. It also provides funding for scholarships, fellowships, and grants to support professional development in critical minerals sectors globally.\n* By addressing workforce gaps through targeted workforce reforms and fostering international educational collaboration, the Act seeks to ensure a robust and skilled labor force capable of meeting the growing demand for critical minerals essential to national security and clean energy technologies.\n\n\n\n# SEE REPORT BELOW:\n\n# [Critical Minerals Report Cover](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Critical%20Minerals%20Report%20Cover%20%281%29-merged%20%281%29.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbo4mypi2h6e1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed947957109970fa1655d7283e1e3e708e48964\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u58cki0q2h6e1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91e0d0cac3a59d9e8f0ecaaaa10ab0ce73991ab\n\n# MEANWHILE..... on DEC. 10th, 2024~ The US DOE to invests US$17M on critical minerals technology projects\n\n[US DOE to invest US$17M on critical minerals technology projects - Canadian Mining Journal](https://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/us-doe-to-invest-us17m-on-critical-minerals-technology-projects/)\n\n[U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer M.

Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.\n\nThis report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.\n\n**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples \n\nTesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: \n\n**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla\u2019s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla\u2019s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. \n\n**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA\u2019s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla\u2019s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. \n\n**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla\u2019s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\\~7x) and Toyota (\\~6x). \n\nTech Companies EV/EBITDA: \n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): \\~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. \n* Apple (AAPL): \\~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.\n\nThese valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. \n\n**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla\u2019s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.\n\n**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla\u2019s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. \n\n**Financial Performance Analysis** \n\nRevenue Growth Deceleration Tesla\u2019s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.\n\nTesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. \n\nPolicy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump\u2019s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. \n\nFree Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. \n\nCompetitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla\u2019s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: \n\n* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. \n* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. \n\nVolkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. \n\n**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** \n\nTesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as \"Full Self-Driving,\" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy \n\n* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. \n   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company\u2019s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.\n*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. \n   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. \n\n**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.\n\n* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. \n\n**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla\u2019s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla\u2019s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. \n\nRegulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological\u2014it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla\u2019s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. \n\nCost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla\u2019s **already declining gross margins**. \n\nReliance on Low Costs: Tesla\u2019s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**\u2014both untenable given Tesla\u2019s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla\u2019s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla\u2019s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle\u2014the holy grail of autonomy\u2014highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla\u2019s competitive edge in the autonomy race. \n\n**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla\u2019s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla\u2019s existing commitments. \n\nDevelopment Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. \n\nCompetition: Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. \n\nOptimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: \n\n**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. \n\nLack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla\u2019s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers\u2014producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla\u2019s financial and technical limitations.\n\nLevel 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. \n\nVehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing\u2014placing further pressure on Tesla\u2019s finances. \n\nFinancial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk\u2019s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla\u2019s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.\n\nInvestor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla\u2019s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on Musk\u2019s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company\u2019s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla\u2019s business strategy. \n\nUnlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla\u2019s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla\u2019s brand reputation**. Tesla\u2019s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla\u2019s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla\u2019s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. \n\nTesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology \n\n* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. \n* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. \n* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. \n\nTesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. \n\n**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. \n\nTesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. \n\n**Legal and Regulatory Risks** \n\n* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. \n* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla\u2019s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla\u2019s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: \n* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. \n* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. \n* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla\u2019s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company\u2019s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. \n* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla\u2019s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. \n* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla\u2019s market share. \n* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. \n* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla\u2019s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. \n* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. \n* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla\u2019s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus\u2014all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. \n\nAs competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla\u2019s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla\u2019s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors. \n\nDisclaimer: This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Today, marketing activities are influenced by globalization and internalization of business, new legal rules, and regulations, consumer values, and demands.\n\n## Company and Industry Background\n\nThe automotive industry is one of the leading industries in the world. The automotive industry aims to maintain the level of service and product quality and develop strategies to improve its products/services. Ford was established in 1903 as a converted factory. In a century, the company becomes the second-largest automaker in the USA. Today, Ford employs 283,000 employees and operates more than 100 factories around the globe. Its market share in the US auto market is about 17.7%. The market leader is General Motors with about 24.6% of the market share. Ford produces all types of passenger vehicles and trucks. A special offering involves Touring cars, Rally, Sports Cars, busses, tractors, etc. In general, Ford is well-positioned in the market to take on this important global leadership role. It has the global resources and certainly has the technological capability (Ford Home Page, 2007).\n\n## Marketing Perspectives\n\nAccording to the Annual Report (2006), the company provides a successful marketing activity that allows it to earn $12,613 M (net income). From the report, it is evident that the goal of the company is to provide the opportunity to personalize purchases. In this case, the Internet and e-commerce create great opportunities for the automotive industry (and customers) to hasten the process of purchase. Ford underlines that \u201cgrowth in wholesales (i.e., volume) will be greatest in emerging markets in the next decade, we expect that the mature automotive markets (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and Japan) will continue to be the source of a majority of global industry revenues\u201d (Annual Report, 2006). An overall business strategy, potential, and capability to support high-performance environments are the key elements for the next years. The policy of safety adopted by Ford is the main strategic criteria. Technological forces generate problem-solving inventions. Ford target is on average as dependent on reliable innovations and technology as any other business (Crawford 2003).\n\nTo resist competition, Ford uses marketing to increase customer loyalty and commitment. \u201cWe expect, however, that a decline in or the inability to increase vehicle prices could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to purchase over time higher-end, more expensive vehicles and/or vehicles with more features\u201d (Annual Report, 2006). Ford has several options for addressing the problem of price competition. The choices are dic\u00adtated in part by product and market competition. In North America, Ford is forced to switch to offshore sourcing of certain components to keep costs and prices competitive. In particular, the Far East and Asia are emerging as attractive markets for Ford. The specification in Ford is determined as a result of an organization\u2019s policy. This is the process of designing quality into the service. Sales strategy is on a one-to-one basis (Kotler and Armstrong, 2005).\n\n## Marketing and Competitive Advantage\n\nThe auto market is not in maturity one, and today it offers a limited opportunity for high profits, so it sets about developing products that are both distinc\u00adtive and could be sold at a premium price. A specialized product range necessitates a clear identification of the target market (Kotler and Armstrong 2005). The original mission of the company makes it clear that it is in the relatively unexploited \u2018 sector that allows the opportunity for innovation. Ford sets out to create a range of high-quality products that are distinctive in shape and price (Ford Home Page, 2007).\n\n## Environmental Laws and their Impact on Ford\n\nCurrent environmental laws and regulations become a real threat fro Ford and its market position. Many European countries and the USA require that automakers improve their technologies and reduce gas emissions. These policies force companies like Ford to spend millions of dollars on R&D and new production methods. The main research trends are hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol on global warming requires ecologically safe solutions (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007).\n\n## Competitive Advantage\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry, we can help! Get a 100% original paper in just 1 hour. [Click here to get started](https://ohmyessay.com/?cid=3431)!\n\nFollowing M. Porter, a company creates a competitive advantage if the earnings of the company exceed their costs (Kotler and Armstrong 2005). It is possible to say that Ford has a competitive advantage in the industry introducing new products and unique services for potential consumers. New product development will open new markets for Ford and allows attract a new target audience. Ford becomes more market-focused than less successful firms in selecting opportunities for product development, and in creating products to market needs (Annual Report, 2006). It also concentrates on developing products that build on core competencies and skills. Today, Ford is good at communicating the desirability and requirements of product development internally to avoid the disruptions that new developments can bring. So, a new conceptually new car is the market need and Ford can be the first company which starts its manufacturing (Crawford, 2003).\n\nThe strategy towards a hydrogen car is the main priority of the company today to compete in the future. Conceptually new Car is the future of the industry. For Ford, consolidation in its present products presents adequate opportunities and requires a search for alternatives that build upon the company\u2019s present knowledge and skills. In the case of product development, Ford will maintain the security of its present markets while changing prod\u00aducts or developing new ones (Ford Home Page 2007). Another strategy concerns existing products. In the case of Asian market development, Ford maintains the security of its present products while venturing into new market areas. Asian market development can include entering Indian and South Korean, China markets exploiting new uses for the product or spreading into new geographical areas. Of course, market development and product development may go hand in hand, since the move into a new market segment may require developments of variants to the existing product range.\n\n\u201cAs part of our acceleration of the Way Forward plan, 70 percent of Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury products (by volume) in North America will be new or significantly upgraded by the end of 2008 compared with 2006 models; these efforts will include the expansion of our product lineup in growth segments such as crossover vehicles\u201d (Annual Report, 2006).\n\nSuperiority over competitors is achieved through a differentiation and cost leadership strategy..Price competition supported by improved quality, is likely to feature highly as it fights for survival in markets faced with over-capacity. Within a rapidly changing environment, this kind of development ensures that a company will survive. the main priority of Ford is to satisfy consumer needs and adapt to the new competitive environment. Branding, advertising, promotion, and additional services to customers and product innovation strengthen Ford\u2019s image. The value proposition is based on the idea that Ford\u2019s products meet the needs of diverse customer targets proposing high quality and low cost (Annual Report, 2006)\n\n## Segmentation and Positioning\n\nFord chooses to position its products using a personalization strategy. This strategy helps the company to appeal to the consumers\u2019 minds with offer\u00adings. Positioning of the brand can be characterized by establishing trustworthiness, confidence, and competence for customers. This strategy is supported by the buying process and the pricing. Also, the positioning strategy of Ford helps the customers to have the product within their minds. To address the target market Ford creates customers\u2019 trust to make them willingly follow the company. Ford positions itself as \u2018a save the car for the whole family. It teaches consumers that safety is the main criterion when choosing a new car. Also, it appeals to consumers with low prices and high quality of its products (Kotler and Armstrong 2005; Ford Motor Company Press Releases 2007).\n\nTo name the target group, Ford identifies groups of consumers with similar wants and needs. In general, targeting is the act of evaluating and comparing the identified groups and then selecting one or more of them as the prospect with the highest potential. A marketing mix is then devised that will pro\u00advide the organization with the best return on sales while simultaneously creating the maximum amount of value to consumers (Annual Report 2006). As Ford wants to penetrate an existing market, it must offer more value than competitors\u2014better benefits and lower prices. It should utilize three basic criteria for assessing opportunity in target markets: current size of the segment and anticipated growth potential, competition, and compatibility with the company\u2019s overall objectives, and the feasibility of successfully reaching a designated target.\n\nSegmentation will be used to understand individual customers in the sports marketplace and to group them to form distinct segments which are identifiable, accessible, and substantial. At its simplest, a consumer segmentation may be Non-user, Competitor\u2019s customer, Low-value customer, High-value customer (Fill 1999). From the geo-demographic, Ford is oriented on all ages and both gender. The majority of its customers belong to the low and middle classes. Its sales cover all geographical locations. Lifestyle allows determining how customers live: the core of the customer group is blue-collar workers. Ford\u2019s customers value innovation and quality but prefer to buy a safe and \u2018cheap\u2019 car.\n\nPorter\u2019s 4P\u2019s involve product, place, promotion, and price. Pricing The unique market pricing strategy is a part of deliberate attempts to reach a global market segment that is willing to buy a particular product. Ford calls its pricing strategy True Blue Pricing which allows: \u201cbetter reflect final selling prices, lowering the sticker prices on most 2006 model year vehicles\u201d (). This pricing strategy is appropriate in the introductory phase of the product life cycle when both production capacity and competition are limited. By setting a deliberately high price, demand is limited to innovators and early adopters who are willing and able to pay the price. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell on the strength of our products rather the amount of the incentive,\u201d said Steve Lyons, group vice president, North American Marketing, Sales and Service. \u201cWith a strong, fresh product lineup we are best positioned to take advantage of this pricing strategy\u201d (Hewett 2007).\n\nUnique product design and image attract millions of consumers and help the company to create its brand image. All its products have a perceived uniqueness in a broad mar\u00adket. This is an extremely effec\u00adtive strategy for defending market position and obtaining above-average finan\u00adcial returns; unique products often command a premium price. This marketing strategy helps to deliver customer value in a way that clearly distinguishes the product from its competitors. The recent new products are Lincoln MKX, Ford Expedition, and Lincoln Navigator in North America; Ford S-MAX, Ford Galaxy, and Ford Transit in Europe; Jaguar XK, Land Rover Freelander 2/LR2, Volvo S80, and Volvo C30, and Mazda CX-9 (Annual report 2006). Place Ford sells its products through dealers. This channel offers variety but it is focused on a marketing mix aimed at all target markets. Promotion Using a mar\u00adket development strategy, Ford captures a larger share of a market for current products through market saturation and market pene\u00adtration. The aim is to seek to create committed customers, not customers who are \u2018locked in\u2019. To develop a strong brand image and appeal to consumers, Ford uses service-based loyalty, incentive programs, and customer loyalty programs. Incentive programs involve immediate benefit promotions when the consumer reward for purchasing is immediate, and, as with most incentives, the sooner the reward can be expected and received after the qualifying action, the greater will be the positive effects of that incentive in stimulating purchase action. Included in this promotion category are price reductions; gifts. Customer loyalty programs include a rewards program for healthcare centers buying 10 phones for their patients. Marketing Communication strategy is based on online and offline advertising and promotion. The informative website is the top priority for Ford. On the one hand, it helps the company to sustain its brand image and deliver better services to customers (Crawford, 2003).\n\n## Demographics\n\nThe appointment of the new CEO, Allan Mulally, in 2006 has marked a new era in the company\u2019s growth. Allan Mulally plans to develop a new market of plug-in hybrids. In 2007, the company launches a new campaign aimed to investigate the market position. Rationalization may include selecting new intermediaries, assigning new responsi\u00adbilities to old intermediaries, or establishing direct marketing operations. Strategic moves are made towards new technology achievements and safety (Fill, 1999). In general, Ford has a great impact on the world\u2019s auto market creating a new culture of low-cost safe vehicles affordable for millions of people. The goal of the company is \u201cto build more of the products that people really want and value. Exciting new products that reflect the needs of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s customers, with striking designs that are safer, more fuel efficient and offer even greater value\u201d (Annual Report 2006). Ford\u2019s strategy processes satisfy the requirements of diverse customer groups. Thus, the company is criticized for its current strategies and policies. \u201cThe Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) deemed the ad for the Focus Zetec \u201cmisleading\u201d through its use of footage from the film, which featured the manufacturer\u2019s Mondeo model\u201d (Ford Motors Criticized, 2007). Also, Ford is often criticized for its great cultural impact and cultural change in Asian and African countries (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007).\n\nThrough its local production facilities, Ford makes an impact on the economy as most countries feel a lack of equal access to the world\u2019s material assets, including technological resources, and there is less linkage between urbanization and industry \u2013 an informal economy often predominates, and the spatial segregation is overlaid by ethnicity, caste, religion, and language. Meanwhile, a dispersal of pro\u00adductive wealth is underway as global corporations establish operations in key developing countries like Brazil and China. Many economists agree that this dis\u00adpersal will narrow the gap between poor and rich nations. Back in the industrialized nations, however, there is an increasing sense of social distress as work\u00aders see their plants close and jobs shipped out of the country (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007). In addition, the globalization of industries such as steel, automobiles, and consumer electronics has cre\u00adated surplus production capacity on a massive scale. The existence and importance of large players with room for strategic decisions about trade, FDI, foreign production, and technology transfers must be accounted for in analyses of economic globalization.\n\n## References\n\n\n\nIf you're feeling stuck or need expert assistance, there\u2019s a solution!

Excludes: > Future cash charges or reserves. > Past cash charges or losses. > Write-downs of accounts receivable. > Deferred Revenue Addback: Adjustments for recognized deferred revenue. > Non-Recurring Fees: Cash payments related to the agreement, loan documents, and PWI Purchase Transaction (up to $1.9 million if incurred by January 1, 2021). > Non-Recurring and Extraordinary Losses: As approved by the lender. > Integration Costs for PWI Purchase Transaction: IT and accounting expenses up to $200,000 (if incurred within 12 months of the closing date).\n\n**Special Conditions:** Contingent Commission Income: Only included in net income if: > Actually received in cash. > Confirmed as payable in writing or electronically and due within 90 days.\n\n**EBITDA Run Rate:** This metric is not intended to be guidance by management regarding the future earnings of the Company; rather, it is intended to capture the twelve-month earnings of what the Company currently owns or has recently acquired; as such, it includes: The actual operating results of our Extended Warranty businesses for the prior twelve months > The investment income associated with our Extended Warranty float, adjusted to reflect expected higher rollover reinvestment earnings associated with the current interest rate environment > KSX twelve months actual results, adjusted for: > Last twelve months of results for SPI and DDI, based on actual and our QofE due diligence.\n\nThe company utilizes the EBITDA Run Rate as a proxy for free cash flow because it provides a clearer view of earnings potential without the distorting impact of taxes. The company\u2019s operations are intentionally asset-light, targeting only asset-light businesses, which significantly reduces maintenance capex requirements. As a result, EBITDA aligns more closely with free cash flow compared to typical businesses. Additionally, the company benefits from significant net operating losses (NOLs) stemming from challenges under prior management, which effectively minimize its taxable income. These NOLs reduce or eliminate the need to allocate cash for taxes, further aligning EBITDA with free cash flow during periods when these tax benefits are available. Together, the asset-light operational model and tax advantages underscore the cash-generating strength of the business, providing a clearer perspective on its earnings potential.\n\n**Incentive-Based KPIs:**\u00a0Unknown but may be tied to net income based on the 2023 Pay For Performance section of the 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\n**Executive Compensation:**\u00a0Base Salary.

In response to this shifting paradigm, there was recently a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/6yth9k/the_need_for_axis_superprops/) about potential Axis \u201csuperprops\u201d that could potentially compete with both current and soon-to-be  Allied opposition.  However, as well-meaning as that thread may be, it is rife with misinformation. \n\nIn an effort to right the wrongs of that thread, my post shall clarify four things: \n\n* The definition of a \u201csuperprop\u201d, \n\n* That the Axis powers and USSR have absolutely zero indigenous competitors to field against Allied superprops, \n\n* That the current matchmaking superprops get is inherently unfair, \n\n* An alternative proposition to balance Allied superprops is to have US vs. UK matchups so they don\u2019t get downtiered into clubbing Axis props, or uptiered into getting clubbed by Axis jets.\n\nHopefully I can hold your attention on this long, detailed journey. My goal is that by the end of this post, you understand my reasoning for the above convictions. \n\n----\n\n######**Superprops**\n\nSo first things first, what exactly is a \u201csuperprop\u201d? This appears to be a term which has no historical usage during the time piston-engined hotrods were being produced, prior to the advent of the jet age. It seems to primarily have come to light on aviation forums, and therefore, it has been picked up by the WT community. For our purposes, we shall define a superprop as a post-war, high-performance fighter that generally boasts flight characteristics - predominantly speed and rate of climb (RoC) - which put any and all WW2-era fighters to shame. The exceptions to this rule are few and far between, with the Allies being responsible for them. \n\n\nBut which specific props currently in the game are superprops? Here\u2019s a list of them, with potential additions thrown in as well:\n\n* **US:** P-51H-5, F8F-1/1B, F7F-3\n\n* **Future US Additions:** P-82B, F4U-5, F8F-2, F7F-3N, A2D-1, XP-72, and others\n\n* **UK:** Spitfire F. Mk.22/24, Tempest Mk.II, Hornet F.3 (20 PSI)\n\n* **Future UK Additions:** Spiteful F. 14/16, Seafang F.31/32, Sea Fury F.X, Fury 1 (Sabre VII), Tempest Mk.VI, Hornet F.1 (25 PSI), Sea Hornet NF.21 (20 PSI, derated engines), and others\n\nYep, that\u2019s right. There\u2019s not a single non-Allied superprop on there. No, your Bf 109 K-4 isn\u2019t one, nor is your Ta 152. The La-9 isn\u2019t one either, and the G.56 sure as hell isn\u2019t one even if it\u2019s proven to be one of the deadliest Axis fighters in WT. Japan hasn\u2019t got anything either, save for possibly their Ki-83. But do any of these nations have indigenous designs which could compete if added to the game?\n\nThe short answer is no. But I promised gory details and a long post, so let\u2019s wade through the murky waters of late-war, prototype, and/or paper Axis prop design. Keep in mind that for aircraft types to be truly viable in WT, they must have reasonably detailed flight data and design specifications need to be readily available. This generally means that prototypes and well-documented planned production runs are possible, but napkin drawings have little place within WT\u2019s confines. Let\u2019s discuss the possibilities, shall we?\n\n**Germany:**\n\n* Ta 152 H and Fw 190 D-12 with Jumo 213EB engine. This engine provides 200 more HP over the current 213E that is fitted in the production planes. Full production of these planes with the Jumo 213EB was [intended to take place by July \u201845](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/290907072189693952/355856188291940353/unknown.png?width=545&height=177), but for obvious reasons that plan never came to fruition. Nevertheless, there does appear to be some [performance  data](https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/189182-ta-152h-1-and-fw-190d-12-d-13-with-jumo-213eb-engines/) for the Ta 152 H and D-12 with this engine, although the engine was also slated for the D-11 and D-13.  While this would be an extremely significant boon to Germany\u2019s ability to compete with Allied superprops, they still wouldn\u2019t hold a candle to props like the P-51H, Fury 1, and Hornet F.1 - all props which boast 26+ m/s RoC at optimal altitude (SL), and are much faster than these Teutons at nearly any given altitude. Not to mention that their handling would be worse than their Allied counterparts as well, considering their airframes were designed largely for bomber interception rather than air superiority. Sadly, simply throwing more power at the existing  Kurt Tank designs will not save Germany, but it will mitigate part of the issue for sure.\n\n* Bf 109 K-14, a plane of mystical nature. In short, this plane is an absolute joke. First of all, there is the highly controversial debate over the K-14\u2019s existence - with erroneous reports of the period either intending to say \u201cG-14\u201d or \u201cK-4\u201d rather than \u201cK-14\u201d. Many of the basic hallmarks of the K-14\u2019s design were never actually completed or pursued - its DB 605L was simply a late '43/early '44 DB 605 A with a two-speed supercharger on it that made 1700 HP, and its 4 bladed propellor was neither produced nor agreed upon for the prototype stage. Regardless, even if the K-14 was built, it would have 300 HP less than the K-4\u2019s existing DB 605 DCM on 1.98 ata boost which produces 2000 PS. Development of the DB 605 L was later abandoned in late \u201844 as production efforts were focused on the new 605 DC engine to be fitted to the K-4, as well as further testing of more advanced Doras and Ta 152s as shown above. We also do not have a definitive source which can agree on armament for the K-14, with some stating a complement of 3 30mm cannons ( 2 MK108s in wings, 1 MK103 in motor) or just 1 30mm cannon in the motor (MK 103). Yet others claim that armament was identical to the K-4. Confusion aside, even if we assume that the K-14 did fly with the DB 605 L, this plane would be extremely underpowered, with performance that\u2019d likely be worse than the Japanese Ki-94-II, a plane that already has been a huge disappointment in the eyes of many. In all respects but altitudes at 10K meters and higher, the K-14 is much worse than the K-4. It is *extremely* slow at SL, with only about 530 kph being achieved, and the calculated RoC of ~14-15m/s is pitiful as well. As much as I hate to say it, the pinnacle of 109 development ends with the fantastic K-4 of 2000 PS, which is represented in-game. However, even our ideal-performing K-4 can struggle against the late-war 18 PSI Spitfire F. Mk.14 though, largely due to the airframe rather than the engine. Unless Gaijin invents their own K-14 (which shouldn\u2019t happen), there's nothing from Messerschmitt's stable\u2026or is there?\n\n* Bf 109 K-6, the bomber destroyer Kurfurst. This plane is more or less identical to the K-4. Same power from the same engine, same propellor, same basic airframe. The K-6 sets itself apart from the K-4 by virtue of its internally wing-mounted MK108 cannons, with 40 RPG. MG151/20 20mm cannons were also considered as options for the internally mounted guns. The K-6 still maintains the 2x 13mm MGs and MK108 containing 65 rounds mounted through the motor. This was a Kurfurst variant that was likely the last ever made, with 1 prototype being tested before the war\u2019s end. However, due to the increased weight, the K-6 would be a worse plane in fighter vs. fighter engagements than the K-4, so while this plane would be a good addition, it doesn\u2019t provide the Germans any parity.\n\n...and that's about it for the Germans. While there were some other radical prop designs, they either proved to be failures and worse than the planes they intended to replace ( Me 209/309) or  never materialized as the Germans were invested in jet design.\n\n**Italy:**\n\n* Re.2006. Built, never flown, and has virtually no documentation besides basic schematics and performance estimates. This is essentially the revered mid-war Re.2005 modified to accommodate the larger DB 603 engine which was also used in the G.56 and a number of other applications. It was likely intended for production, but Italy\u2019s broken manufacturing industry couldn\u2019t support the intense labor and skill required to make the plane a reality. Due to these extenuating circumstances, I am wholly for Gaijin essentially making this plane from scratch since we have data for the DB 603 engine, schematics for the plane, and a rough idea of its performance estimates/calculations. Despite the promising nature of the Re.2006, this is still a 5.7 prop at best and does nothing to bolster the German situation against Allied superprops. Nevertheless, it is still an excellent plane to add to the 5.7 stable, and would provide Axis with yet another option to fight the Allies at this BR.\n\n* M.C.206.This plane is nothing more than the existing C.205N2 that\u2019s been put on a diet. It has the same early DB 605A as the C.205 Serie 3 and G.55, but has a larger, lighter wing. Judging from the engine alone, it\u2019s pretty obvious that this isn\u2019t even capable of competing with a P-51D-30, let alone true superprops.\n\n* M.C.207. This was Macchi\u2019s unbuilt, planned competitor to the G.56 and Re.2006, as it would\u2019ve used the same DB 603 engine as them, with necessary modifications to the airframe. Gaijin would have to make this plane up themselves, which I am against since this plane never existed, but even if they did, it wouldn\u2019t be significantly better than the G.56 or Re.2006.\n\n...so nothing game-changing for the Italians, what about the other nations?\n\n**Japan:**\n\n* Two of their most promising prototypes, the Ki-87 (premium) and Ki-94-II (recent event vehicle) are already in the game, and needless to say, they aren't particularly good. The Ki-87's FM needs to be corrected, but even then, it'd roughly be on par with the Tempest at best. The Ki-94-II is fairly poor as it was a design that catered to extreme high-altitude bomber interception. Neither of these designs are capable of competing with Allied superprops, as they already find themselves struggling against 4.7-6.0 Allies.\n\n* Ki-83 on high-octane fuel. While we know that the US carried out tests on the plane under this condition, we have virtually no data on it, and therefore cannot surmise how the plane would have performed. Therefore, a \u201cboosted\u201d Ki-83 is an impossibility.\n\n* Prototype/unbuilt Ki-84 variants with the Ha-219 engine of 2500 HP. These would be similar in concept to the Ta 152 H and 190 D-12 slated to receive Jumo 213EB engines. These Japanese counterparts would benefit from the power increase, but still likely remain the lesser plane compared to the best of the Allies. Some versions were to mount a supercharger (84-R), while others were to remain without one (84-N). For all intents and purposes, we don\u2019t know how these two variants would perform as we have no data on them. However, if implemented, they would reduce the struggle Japan encounters at top tier prop matchmaking. Overall, not a bad idea to introduce them, even if it\u2019s rather far fetched.\n\n* Ki-73. Entirely paper, and never built since it was abandoned on the drawing board. There is absolutely zero data for this plane, and it\u2019s basically impossible to add. At least the Ho 229 V3 and R2Y2 V1 had fairly well documented performance estimates/calculations. This plane has none of those. Even if added, it would appear that its only saving grace is acceptable speed, and even that would be robbed from it by the P-51H, F4U-5, Hornet, and Fury.\n\n* Ki-64: This plane was actually built and flown. It doesn\u2019t have a wealth of data for it, but there\u2019s at least [some information](https://oldmachinepress.com/2016/10/20/kawasaki-ki-64-experimental-fighter/) available. The prototype never had its proposed armament fitted to it, but like many of the prototypes already in the game, Gaijin could make an exception in this case since this seems like a plane where reasonable judgement could be exercised regarding its implementation. Based on the performance indicated in the linked article, it still doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of competing with superprops, but it would surely be among the best that Japan has.\n\nBeyond the above listed prototypes, there isn\u2019t much else. I suppose there's the never-flown, only-built-as-a-wooden-mockup Ki-94-I? Looking at the design though, even with the overly optimistic performance estimates, it doesn't look like it'd stack up all that well. \n\nOn to the USSR, which despite technically being an \u201cAllied\u201d power, finds itself in the same position as its Axis enemies. \n\n**USSR:**\n\nThe Russians have nothing that could compete on an allied superprop level. They barely even compete at the existing high tier level, let alone future superprops. After the La-9, Russia heavily invested its resources in jet development. There's still some options, but they don't flesh out much:\n\n* La-9/11 are in the game already, and as per their recent revision to their FM, are both overtiered a tad. La-11 isn't even close to being a superprop, and the La-9's revision has made it a 5.7 prop rather than the 6.0 prop it once was. Neither of these planes are capable enough, and the Lavochkin line ends here.\n\n* Yak-3 (VK-108). Better performance than the VK-107 with worse overheating, but still an exceedingly shitty airframe for high speed prop combat, with the same Vne as other Yak-3s. Would work, but always be at a disadvantage due to low rip speed. A worthwile addition to the main-tree in any case.\n\n* Yak-3U. More akin to a 5.7 prop, doesn't solve much. It\u2019s a standard Yak-3 with the same engine from the La-7/9 and the appropriate modifications to the fuselage. \n\n* La-7 prototypes with the M-71 and M-83 engines. Quite good performance, and a decent airframe, unlike their Yakovlev brethren.  These are pretty good planes, but would likely be 5.7 for the M-71, and 6.0-3 for the M-73 versions. Don't really compare to the proposed Ki-84s or Germans, let alone allied superprops. However, the M-73 would provide some parity, although I can't imagine that an entire USSR team would consist of VK-107/8 Yaks and M-73 La-7s just to compete with the Allies. \n\nAs shown, every nation that isn\u2019t the US or UK cannot compete with the latter\u2019s superprops. But why does that matter? Don\u2019t superprops fight early jets most of the time anyway? That should be balanced, right?\n\nWrong. Let\u2019s get into the third movement of this post.\n\n----\n\n######**What's Broken with Current Superprop Matchmaking**\n\nPut simply, props objectively have nothing on \u201ctrue\u201d 7.0 jets, no matter how powerful they may be. True 7.0 jets such as the P-80A, F-84B, Me 262A, Ho 229, Arado C, F-84G, Meteor Mk.3, Attacker FB.1, Vampire FB.5, MiG-9 in both variants, Kikka, and R2Y2 are all superior to props despite their (generally) worse acceleration, climb rate, maneuverability, and altitude performance. You probably find this shocking, but there is a simple truth behind this statement: Jets are able to maintain a level flight speed that is 100+ kph faster than just about any prop, and despite the fact that they are objectively worse in most other metrics, *speed is all that matters in combat where jets are involved.*\n\nNow of course, current props regularly kill 7.0 jets, but is this due to the performance of said props? Or is it due to the incompetence and poor piloting of early jet players? To be honest, it\u2019s little bit of both. For example, a slow plane such as G.55 Centauro will have great difficulty killing jets don\u2019t go headon or stall in front of it - obviously faster, more capable props like the Tempest Mk.II will have the necessary advantages to capitalize on a rookie jet pilot\u2019s mistakes. But therein lies the key issue: in order for superprops to win a match against a jet team (as all Axis teams are at 6.3 vs. 7.0 matches), *the jets have to give up all their single biggest advantage and play into the strengths of the props*. A prop vs. jet fight is never a truly balanced matchup, even from the get-go. Altitude doesn\u2019t matter. A Spitfire Mk.24 or P-51H that climbs to 6K in under 5 minutes doesn\u2019t have any impact on the 650+kph fight that\u2019s evolving on the deck. Once a prop at altitude chooses to dive on the jets below them, it is unable to maintain a sufficiently high speed for pursuit and must either convert that energy back into altitude, or continue bleeding its speed in level-flight pursuit. Both of these scenarios play right into the jet pilot\u2019s hands, since he can simply sit at his higher cruising speed and remain out of the prop\u2019s reach by abusing the speed differential that he has over superprops. \n\nTo illustrate this concept further, let\u2019s consider the F7F Tigercat. Easily among the fastest props in the game with incredible energy retention, it is [absolutely useless against jets](https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/370387-planned-changes-to-vehicle-battle-ratings-july-2017/&do=findComment&comment=7046279) which outspeed it and rob it of its sole advantage against enemies, thus allowing the matchup to be skewed in the jet\u2019s favor. Additionally, since the F7F emphasizes speed rather than maneuverability, it cannot win the maneuvering engagement either. We can find another example too in the most feared prop of WT: the Spitfire F. Mk.24. Though it\u2019s tremendously maneuverable with fantastical energy retention and acceleration, it lacks the sustainable level speed to even come close to catching a cruising early jet. Situations like these arise among every current superprop, and will continue to pose an imbalance for all future superprops as you are unable to truly compete with a plane that maintains a vastly superior speed advantage over you in the RB environment. Regardless of the fact that inexperienced ones will regularly die to a prop\u2019s guns, props vs. jets simply isn\u2019t balanced and enjoyable for either party, as the props can simply choose to maintain altitude, leaving the jets with no option but to climb to them, or waste time flying around at low altitude. This proves that balance in the game must be done objectively according to plane performance rather than player performance - the crux of my argument.\n\nAs illustrated, these are the current issues with superprop MM - it is a given that in downtiers superprops will crush the WW2-era prop opposition, and in uptiers you will get crushed by the early jets, all things considered objectively. So if superprops can\u2019t fight other T4 props or early T5 jets, what are they to do? Why are they in the game?\n\nDo not lose all hope - I have an alternative proposition that should largely solve this issue.\n\n----\n\n######**Fixing Superprop Matchmaking: The Superprop Meta**\n\nEnter *\u201cThe Superprop Meta\u201d*, with matchmaking that pits the very best of the US against the UK\u2019s finest, as they duke it out over alt-history locations. \n\nCurrently, we have a slight taste of this with our current Preparation for Hokkaido map, but this map\u2019s mechanics are poorly designed, with objectives that turn high-BR prop fights into a B-29 interception meta. There are several reasons for the map\u2019s poor reception among the WT community, namely that the meta Hokkaido forces is one of despair, due to: \n\n* Map design that is poorly optimized for slow-climbing US planes. This bit is often blown out of proportion, especially with existing props like the P-47s and F-82s getting an airspawn, and planes like the late P-38s, D-30, F8F, and F7F climbing competitively. However, this argument is also a non-issue for US superprops. Late-war and post-war US design ideology shifted from escort fighters to interceptors, air superiority fighters, and multi-role planes. All the planes listed at the beginning of this post boast excellent climb rates, along with the typical heavy US emphasis on speed and multirole strike ability. This makes them *extremely* competitive against UK opposition, and comparatively are much easier to fly than their slow-climbing, one-dimensional predecessors that require long bouts of patient sideclimbing and conservative playstyle. In many cases, planes like the P-51H, F4U-5, and XP-72 are downright better than a lot of their UK counterparts. This doesn\u2019t mean that the UK isn\u2019t competitive though, as designs like the Sabre-powered Fury 1, Hornet F.1 w/ 25 PSI, and Spiteful are more than capable of competing with US superprops. Most importantly, the designs of each country are so evenly matched, that playing in the superprop MM would require a large knowledge of your opposition\u2019s strengths in addition to nuanced technical skill, thus providing a challenging, high skill ceiling for experienced players. Best of all, since the US planes are finally competitive within the \u201cClimb Thunder Meta\u201d, this MM also boasts a lower bar of entry for newer players of that nation.\n\n* Bomber mechanics which force a B-17/29 interception meta. This is actually a huge problem at several tiers, since  the bombers get an airspawn which allows them to simply rush the airfield, forcing all UK props (including the Mk.24) to immediately struggle for interception lest their base be destroyed and the match end without any fighter combat. There have been a number of solutions to this issue brought to light, such as giving bombers a lower airspawn or leaving the airspawn as is but preventing the destruction of the airfield from being an auto-win. Another helpful change would be decreasing the overwhelmingly unrealistic strength of bomber DMs. To compensate any one of these possible changes, bomber aficionados could perhaps receive a RP gain buff for dealing base damage, or a lower repair cost. All these solutions seem to be solid ways to make the meta more dynamic, and less about a race to intercept B-29s.\n\n* Poor map objectives/map design. Ground units/naval targets should be scattered out in a less predictable fashion than they are currently. There could even be a set series of variable spawn locations for AI ground units that differ from Hokkaido map to Hokkaido map. \n\nDiscussion about a Hokkaido revamp leads me to my next point: new maps and rotations for Air RB. Hokkaido is simply boring to look at, and new maps could go along way to selling people on this idea. It is also something that the RB Air community pines for with every update.\n\nLuckily, that is extremely easy to do: \n\n* Since the British and Americans were often mutually involved in Pacific theater operations against the Japanese, there could be alternate history matchups on many Pacific maps. \n\n* Due to British and American forces cooperating against the Germans when expanding into Berlin late in the war, the current alt-history operation between the US/UK and USSR could be repackaged into a US vs. UK match. Ditto goes for the US/UK/USSR vs. GER version of the map. If Gaijin wanted to, they could even design a new map based on existing Berlin map assets with a focus on the separate districts of West Berlin occupied by the British and Americans after the war. It could serve as an excellent \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenario should the US and UK have gotten into a heated quarrel over the zone.\n\n* Saving the best for last, a totally new series of maps could be implemented using [War Plan Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Plan_Red) as the location. Originally a US plan drawn up in the \u201820s, it could easily serve as a \u2018what-if\u2019 map should US-UK relations have gone hot in the late \u201840s and early \u201850s. There are 2-4 possible locations for these maps throughout North America, and it could truly be an incredible new addition to the US-UK map rotation at all tiers, with an especially huge boon for the unique facets of \u2018The Superprop MM\u2019.\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it. If you managed to make it through this far, you have my utmost respect - I know it was a long read. So what do you think? Would you like to see true, balanced superprop MM between the US and UK? Do you agree with my notions on superprop vs. jet MM? Would you like to see this in game? \n\nComment away!

Countries across North America, Europe, and Asia are expanding charger networks and offering EV subsidies; global EV sales are projected to nearly triple by 2030, reaching 40 million vehicles annually.\n\nThe incipient wave of EV purchases raises a question: What will happen to the millions of gas-powered cars whose owners no longer want them?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likely answer: Rather than scrapping used gas vehicles or selling them domestically, rich nations will dispatch them to developing countries where limited incomes and low levels of car ownership have created eager buyers for even older, substandard models.\n\nAn influx of used gas cars would be a welcome development for those in the Global South who aspire to automobile ownership, a luxury that many in affluent countries take for granted. But it would undermine efforts to mitigate climate change, since shifting gas guzzlers from one country to another doesn\u2019t lower global emissions. For developing countries themselves, a sharp increase in car ownership could amplify calls to build auto-reliant infrastructure, making it harder to construct the dense neighborhoods and transit networks that can foster more sustainable growth. And since these imported used cars would be fueled by gasoline, air quality would further decline in cities that are already choked with smog.\n\nThe world is in an era of polycrisis, facing concurrent challenges including climate change, toxic air, and extreme inequality. Difficult trade-offs are often inevitable. Such is the case with the thorny issue of what to do with the millions of gas cars that the rich world will discard as its fleets are electrified.\n\nElectrification is a necessary goal. And it\u2019s natural for people in the developing world to desire the same luxuries that characterize middle-class comfort in wealthier countries. The question is how to manage a transition with enormous stakes that has largely been ignored. The experts who do pay attention are growing alarmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried that everything is going to be gas vehicles for many years, maybe decades,\u201d said Godwin Ayetor, a senior lecturer in engineering at Ghana\u2019s Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the health implications, and also the congestion. It\u2019s already difficult to walk through Accra because of all the traffic, and the cars keep coming.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s steady flow of used cars into the Global South could become a torrent as the rich world electrifies. A deluge of gas vehicles would be a double-edged sword for low-income nations \u2014 and a risk to the planet.\n\nHow used cars move from rich nations to poor ones\nAlthough it generates few headlines, a massive industry transports used cars across borders every day, with exporters collecting lower-quality models from dealers and wholesale auctions. Ayetor noted that colonial legacies are reflected in the trade flows: the UK, with its car cabins designed for drivers who keep to the left, tends to ship to former colonies like Kenya and Tanzania that still follow the same rules.\n\nAccording to a report issued in June by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), some 3.1 million used cars were exported in 2022, up from 2.4 million in 2015. Most come from Japan, Europe, and the United States. (In the US, around 7 percent of all cars no longer in use are sent abroad. The rest end up in junkyards where their parts and materiel are sold off.)\n\nAbout one in three exported used vehicles is destined for Africa, followed by Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Imported models often dominate local auto sales, since international carmakers send few new vehicles to the Global South and rarely establish production facilities there. (In sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa has local factories.)\n\nThe developing world\u2019s demand for cars is robust, in large part because comparatively few people own one. According to one 2020 estimate, the US had 860 cars for every 1,000 residents, while South Africa had 176, Morocco 112, and Nigeria just 56. Meanwhile, growing populations provide a steady supply of new potential customers. Africa is home to all of the world\u2019s 20 fastest-growing countries, with Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and Uganda expanding their populations by at least 3 percent per year. (For comparison, the US population is growing at a 0.67 percent rate).\n\nAs long as their price is right, aged or damaged used cars will be snapped up in the Global South. Many vehicles shipped from abroad have been in crashes, stripped of parts, or manufactured decades ago, when emissions and safety rules were more lax. A 2020 study by the government of the Netherlands found that most Dutch used cars sent to Africa lacked a roadworthiness certificate; many were manufactured over 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cOld cars mean old technologies,\u201d said Ayetor, \u201cand old technologies means they don\u2019t have modern systems to reduce the impact of the emissions before they leach out into the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nWealthy countries have generally turned a blind eye to the shoddy quality of used cars sent overseas; they are profitable transactions for domestic businesses and the risks are largely borne elsewhere. \u201cMost countries do not impose significant restrictions on trading unroadworthy or highly polluting vehicles,\u201d concluded a recent study by the International Transport Forum, the transportation arm of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe receiving countries can also take a laissez faire approach. About half the 146 nations examined by UNEP do not regulate used car age or quality. Others have adopted policies such as barring used car imports outright (as in South Africa), banning older cars (as in Kenya, where imported vehicles must be less than eight years old), and scaling import tax rates with the age of the vehicle (as in Ghana).\n\nAdjacent nations may have different import rules, however, which creates loopholes.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that vehicles are exported to one country, and then they go to neighboring countries as well,\u201d said Joseph Mashele, who was an automotive regulator in South Africa before recently joining Jaguar Land Rover.\n\nCase in point: Despite South Africa\u2019s official ban on used cars, tens of thousands still arrive annually.\n\n\u201cReally shady cars make it into emerging economies, because there is still a market for them,\u201d said Andreas Kopf, an author of the ITF\u2019s recent report. His team found that roughly a quarter of used cars sent to the developing world adhere to emissions standards that are at least 21 years old.\n\nMany of these cars lack modern safety features and pollution controls that are commonplace in newer vehicles made in wealthier countries. That is a particular concern in Africa, which despite its low level of car ownership still has the world\u2019s highest rates of road deaths and some of its dirtiest air, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn recent years, the developing world\u2019s voracious appetite for used cars has caught the attention of senior leaders in China, an emerging colossus of automotive manufacturing. Until 2019, China banned the export of used vehicles, focusing instead on supplying its burgeoning domestic market. Now those restrictions have been removed, and the Chinese government is actively promoting the used car trade because it can attract foreign currency and stoke domestic demand for automaking heavyweights like BYD and Geely. By sending older gas-powered cars out of the country, China can also nudge residents to buy new EVs, which the government favors with subsidies and a recent cash-for-clunkers program that provides money to those trading in an older-model car.\n\n\u201cYou can just pull existing internal combustion engine cars out of your fleet, and then you stimulate new sales,\u201d Kopf said. \u201cThis is what they are doing in China.\u201d\n\nAlthough China exported only 40,000 used cars in 2022, that figure is expected to skyrocket. According to the ITF\u2019s analysis, Chinese used car exports may total 8 million vehicles annually within the next decade, more than double current trade flows from Europe, East Asia, and North America combined.\n\nStill, China\u2019s future trade in used cars could be dwarfed by a tsunami of gas vehicles set to depart the wealthy world. Its cause: Electrification.\n\nElectrification will push even more vehicles to the developing world\nWith privately owned automobiles responsible for about 10 percent of global CO2 emissions (and more than twice that share in the US), wealthy nations are rightly moving to electrify their vehicles as quickly as possible. The European Union, for instance, has committed to ending the sales of gas-powered cars by 2035, around the same time as Japan. In the US, the Biden administration has vowed that a majority of new cars will be all-electric or hybrid by 2032.\n\nIn May, electric and hybrid vehicles represented a little less than half of new car sales in the European Union and under 7 percent in the US. But as electrification ramps up, the Global North\u2019s demand for gas cars \u2014 including used ones \u2014 will wane.\n\n\u201cThe total number of cars in rich countries is relatively constant,\u201d said Kopf. \u201cThat means that if an EV is entering the fleet, a combustion engine is leaving.\u201d With fewer people shopping for a used gas car within rich countries, more will likely be sent abroad \u2014 potentially a whole lot more.\n\nNorway, the world\u2019s most aggressive adopter of EVs, provides a preview of what\u2019s to come. With the government providing an array of generous incentives, Norwegians have gone all-in on electric models, which comprise over 90 percent of new car purchases. Around one in four cars on the road in Norway is now electric, compared to under 2 percent in the US.\n\nNorway\u2019s EV embrace has triggered a veritable explosion in exports of used gas vehicles: They more than quadrupled in the decade from 2012 to 2022.\n\nAs other rich nations electrify their own fleets, ITF\u2019s Kopf said he anticipates \u201csimilar behavior\u201d to what Norway has experienced. If used car exports in Europe, East Asia, and North America match Norway\u2019s trajectory, those regions would collectively ship 12 million gas vehicles per year, on top of the potentially 8 million coming from China. A total of 20 million used gas cars exported annually to developing nations would be seven times greater than current levels.\n\nThat would be welcome news for those in lower-income nations who yearn to own their own car, since the laws of supply and demand predict that a growing supply of used vehicles would lower their market price. Ayetor said that \u201ca lot of Africans are hoping\u201d that such a scenario unfolds.\n\nBut Jane Akumu, a Nairobi-based transport expert at UNEP, said that used car buyers in the Global South should be careful what they wish for, because aged models may not be the bargain that they appear. \u201cIf you are importing 20-year-old cars, you have to bring in an equal shipment of parts, because they will break down so quickly,\u201d she told me, noting that immobile cars can clog motorways, thickening traffic as well as smog.\n\nTheoretically, an influx of used cars could reduce emissions and breakdowns if newer, cleaner vehicles were displacing the older and dirtier models currently in use. But no one I spoke with expects that to happen. Instead, imported gas guzzlers would be added to the existing fleet \u2014 increasing total pollution.\n\n\u201cA new used car is not going to replace an older one; it\u2019s just going to be absorbed,\u201d Kopf said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have the 30-year-old car running around, plus the new 10-year-old car.\u201d\n\nA 2010 study of used cars shipped from the US to Mexico supports his point: The authors found that although imported cars were cleaner than the average Mexican car, their arrival still increased total emissions because they added to, rather than supplanted, the preexisting vehicle fleet.\n\nThe world needs a plan to adapt\nThe risks of aged, polluting cars sent abroad will not be borne by the Global South alone. Climate change is a planetary phenomenon; driving a gas guzzler produces the same amount of emissions in Lusaka as it would in London or Los Angeles. Reducing greenhouse gasses requires reducing total vehicle emissions, not just shifting their location.\n\nIn an ideal world, electrification would enable the rich world to scrap its most decrepit gas cars. Instead, wealthy nations are likely to ship them to poorer countries, which will be left to figure out what to do when even the most MacGyver-like mechanics cannot keep them running.\n\n\u201cAll of your worst vehicles end up here,\u201d Ayetor said. \u201cWhen we want to get rid of the vehicle, what do we do?\u201d No wealthy nations currently screen exported vehicles to weed out those that flunk basic quality tests, Kopf said. But that may soon change.\n\nThe European Union is now considering new regulations that would prohibit exporting \u201cend of life\u201d vehicles, requiring that cars shipped abroad obtain a certificate confirming their roadworthiness. Its adoption would be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d according to UNEP\u2019s Akumu. (She and Kopf said they know of no comparable proposals under consideration in North America.)\n\nBut Mashele noted that export controls provide only a partial solution. \u201cSometimes things happen in transit,\u201d he said, \u201cand certain equipment has been tampered with or removed,\u201d making the vehicle more polluting or dangerous upon arrival than when leaving its port of origin. He wants to see stricter emissions and safety checks in the Global South, too.\n\nThose countries have a lot of policy work to do. In 2023 the UNEP gave 57 developing nations a rating of \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cvery weak\u201d for their vehicle import rules, with the bulk of them in Africa. But the UNEP did note some progress, such as the five East African countries that in 2022 required imported vehicles to adhere to the EU\u2019s Euro 4 emissions standards, which were introduced in 2006. That move followed a similar one in 2021 by a bloc of 15 West African countries, which stipulated that imported used cars follow Euro 4 and be less than 10 years old. Syncing such rules can prevent importers from circumventing countries with strong regulations by shipping to their less stringent neighbors instead.\n\nBut even if strict vehicle standards are applied universally, the number of used gas cars flowing into the developing world is still poised to rise as the rich world electrifies. As the ranks of car owners in the Global South expand, many are likely to demand new roads to drive on and more places to park. Bowing to such requests will be risky.\n\nA century ago, American leaders built highways and reconfigured cities to accommodate the automobile, in the process locking the country into car-oriented development that has lengthened commutes, increased emissions, and undermined city life. The automobile\u2019s dominance has also raised the cost of living: The average American spends 16 percent of their income on transportation in 2020, 5 percentage points higher than those in the denser and more transit-rich nations of the European Union.\n\nUNEP\u2019s Akumu is already concerned by what she is seeing in Kenya. A few years ago, she said, nearly half of Nairobi\u2019s children walked to school. But \u201cthat number keeps going down, because when you graduate in income, you want to own a car.\u201d\n\nAs incomes in the Global South grow, density and robust transit service could make driving an option rather than a necessity. For example, South Korea and Taiwan became wealthy nations in the latter half of the 20th century, and both built excellent mass transportation systems. In 2020, their rates of car ownership (458 per 1,000 people in South Korea and 344 per 1,000 in Taiwan) were far below the US (860 per 1,000).\n\nInvesting in multimodal infrastructure now could help lower-income countries avoid the planning mistakes that the US made a century ago. Many residents of the Global South are understandably eager to purchase their first motor vehicle, but \u201cwe need to make sure that an influx of cars does not displace a potential buildup of public transportation,\u201d Kopf said.\n\nA number of such projects are currently in the works, including new subways in Abidjan and Algiers and an urban rail network in Kinshasa. Meanwhile, Tanzania is revamping its rail system, while Botswana and Namibia are building a Trans-Kalahari Railway. As World Bank transport researchers argued in a recent blog post, \u201cinvesting in rail can help put African cities on a more sustainable track,\u201d noting that many existing tracks could be adjusted to ferry people as well as goods.\n\nIndeed, that would be the wisest strategy to manage an impending glut of used gas cars: ensure that people can flourish without one, regardless of where they live.", "Way of Yah Rotated12 \n\n\n\nRotated12 \n\n\n\nRotated12 \n\n\n\nRotated12 \n\n\n\nRotated12 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotated12 \n\n\nI am only I.

This study aims to dissect the disconnect phenomenon through a scientific prism, delving into the nuances of language, truth, and expression. By drawing parallels between cellular interactions, spatiotemporal anomalies, and interpersonal relationships, we seek to unravel the intricate tapestry of disconnect that weaves through our communicative landscape. \n\nBody: \n\nI. Cellular Repulsion as a Model for Disconnection\nAt the microscopic level, electromagnetic repulsion serves as a significant barrier to direct interaction, mirroring the challenges faced in communication. Analogous to the discord in communication, this phenomenon sheds light on the complexities of conveying messages effectively. Essentially at the fundamental level of reality a divide is present. You could call it a disconnect but I believe it's more appropriate to call it set apart.\nMoreover, viewing cellular repulsion through a metaphysical lens presents it as a symbolic representation of the existential isolation inherent in the human experience. Just as charged particles repel each other, individuals encounter divergent worldviews and conflicting ideologies, perpetuating the challenge of genuine connection in a world marked by discord and division. \n\nExtending the cellular repulsion analogy to interpersonal relationships emphasizes the emotional and psychological barriers that hinder meaningful connection even within proximity. These invisible barriers echo the energetic forces impeding cellular bonding, further underscoring the complexities of human interaction and the elusive quest for authentic communication amidst contemporary complexities, including artificial intelligence. \n\nII. The Spatiotemporal Discontinuity Conundrum\nIn the realm of physics, the disconnect between time and space poses a profound conundrum akin to struggles in communication. While intimately intertwined, the separation between time and space challenges our understanding of reality. Analogous to navigating the temporal-spatial divide, bridging the gap between thoughts and verbal articulation presents daunting obstacles. The spatiotemporal discontinuity provides a metaphorical backdrop, illuminating the disconnect characterizing human interactions. \n\nIII. Interpersonal Relationships: A Microcosm of Disconnect\nInterpersonal relationships offer a nuanced microcosm reflecting the disconnect prevalent in human communication, unveiling divergent analogies enriching our understanding of human connections. Analogous to charged particles repelling on a cellular level, individuals in relationships face emotional forces hindering harmonious interactions. This dynamic mirrors the celestial bodies in the universe, balancing gravitational pulls of attraction and repulsion, akin to partners navigating closeness and distance akin to binary stars orbiting in intricate dances. The ebb and flow in human relationships echo the gravitational laws that operate in our universe, balancing moments of connection with periods of emotional separation. \n\nFurthermore, interpersonal bonds could be compared to a tapestry woven from diverse threads representing unique perspectives, much as a tapestry gains complexity and beauty from the interplay of different threads, flourishing relationships intertwining various viewpoints and personalities. Similar to a puzzle in its complexity, relationships require arranging various emotional, psychological, and perceptual pieces to form coherent connections that transcend mere disconnect. \n\nThus, mapping these analogies onto interpersonal relationships enriches our understanding of the interplay between disconnect and connection, highlighting the intricate mosaic of human interactions. \n\nEsoteric Parables \n\n1. **The Veil of Maya**: In esoteric doctrines such as Hindu philosophy, the concept of Maya represents the illusion of separateness and the veiling of ultimate reality. Analogous to the disconnect in communication, where individuals may perceive only surface-level expressions and miss the deeper truths beneath, the Veil of Maya symbolizes the obscured understanding that hinders genuine connection and impedes the transmission of profound insights. \n\n2. **The Tower of Babel**: The biblical story of the Tower of Babel portrays a scenario where linguistic discord leads to a breakdown in communication, resulting in a fragmented world where people speak different languages and struggle to understand one another. Similarly, in esoteric teachings, the Tower of Babel can be seen as a metaphor for the disconnect in communication caused by language barriers, divergent interpretations, and misaligned vibrations that obstruct the transmission of higher knowledge and spiritual insights. \n\n3. **The Alchemical Transmutation**: In alchemical symbolism, the process of transmutation represents the transformation of base elements into pure substances, symbolizing spiritual growth and enlightenment. Analogous to the disconnect in communication, where misunderstandings and misinterpretations can distort the intended message, the alchemical transmutation reflects the challenge of conveying esoteric wisdom accurately and authentically. Just as alchemists strive to purify and refine substances to reveal their true nature, effective communication in esoteric doctrines requires clarity, integrity, and resonance to bridge the gap between the mundane and the profound. \n\n4. **The Echo in the Cave**: Drawing inspiration from Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where prisoners are confined and see only shadowy reflections of reality on a cave wall, the concept of the Echo in the Cave symbolizes the reverberations and distortions that can occur in communication of esoteric truths. Like echoes bouncing off cave walls, esoteric knowledge can be muffled, fragmented, or misunderstood as it is transmitted from teacher to student or from one seeker to another. The Echo in the Cave analogy underscores the challenges of communication in conveying profound spiritual insights amidst the limitations of language, perception, and interpretation, highlighting the need for clarity, patience, and openness in seeking deeper understanding in esoteric doctrines. This is especially relevant today since we are essentially in a echo chamber in which the origination of the echo is mimicry itself. \n\nThe basis of the philosophy will be the disconnect between all things, including cells at the level of electromagnetic repulsion which holds the divide of a synaptic junction. Time and space are disconnected although one is required for the other they are far from one i n the same. The divide of man and God is the greatest of all. Just as man is disconnected from the heavenly father the son of a man is at a disconnect from his earthly father. Look at any father son relationship and at the core you'll always see a sin desperate connect with his father despite constant will to do so. However in this philosophy the main disconnect is that of communication, language and it's many forms are the very representation of ones manifestation. It's how portray how we feel, what we think and etc. However I believe all would agree that words fall short, no matter the vocabulary. Words are mimics for the most part, echoes of times flowing through the manifold of the universe. Abraham Lincoln said, \"I cannot tell a lie\". This is not because he was righteous or perfect, it's because in order to tell a lie one must be capable of truth, in a fallen state where communication is limited the words of a man will not or nor will it ever capture the truth of its entirety, the nuanced nature of truth and depths of the heart are attempted to be translated through the words we say when we could never say enough to truly capture the individual complexities of ones emotions, observations and logic and\u00a0 the impact of their own hindsight and foresight in regard to perspectives of such. Even when non verbal communication is utilized it will send a clearer message but the message is still not clear, no artist has ever said a painting was perfectly done, the realization falls short of the conception just as a word off the tongue is far away from the conceptions those words are in regard too. \n\nJust as man is disconnected from the heavenly father the son of a man is at a disconnect from his earthly father.

Louv's concept underscores the repercussions of reduced outdoor exposure, juxtaposed with increased indoor sedentariness, particularly engrossed in digital screens, which can precipitate myriad physical and mental health challenges. This paradigm shift may result in issues like obesity, attention deficits, compromised stress management, and a diminished affinity for the environment. Unveiling the manifold benefits of nature immersion for holistic well-being, it's imperative to strike a harmonious balance between indoor engagements and outdoor communion to foster a robust and sustainable lifestyle. \n\nThe genesis of this estrangement from nature can be retraced to the revolutionary implementation of artificial lighting, epitomized by the advent of the light bulb. This paradigm-altering invention fundamentally reshaped human interactions with the environment, enabling extended indoor sojourns and disrupting the innate diurnal rhythms of light and darkness. Consequently, a protracted stay indoors propelled a consistent decline in outdoor activities, fostering a disconnection from the natural world and laying the groundwork for the emergence of Nature Deficit Disorder which would eventually grow into attention deficit disorder. \n\nThe psychophysical ramifications of this lifestyle shift are profound. Mentally, the overreliance on artificial illumination and prolonged indoor stays have been associated with elevated stress levels, heightened anxiety, and prevalent depressive symptoms. Prolonged exposure to artificial light, especially during nocturnal hours, can disrupt sleep patterns, giving rise to sleep disorders such as insomnia. \n\nOn a physiological plane, the reduced exposure to natural light and diminished outdoor time owing to artificial lighting are correlated with Vitamin D deficiency, pivotal for skeletal health and overall wellness. Moreover, the confluence of reduced interaction with nature and heightened sedentary behaviors indoors poses a tangible risk for obesity, cardiovascular ailments, and a gamut of other physical health issues. This integrative impact of the transition towards artificial lighting underscores its potential contribution to the symptomatic constellation characterizing Nature Deficit Disorder. \n\nAlthough empirical evidence directly linking light bulb usage with hallucinations remains scarce, anecdotal testimonies attest to perceptual disturbances and hallucinatory experiences associated with prolonged exposure to artificial light sources. These occurrences, often intertwined with conditions such as migraines, epilepsy, or specific mental health disorders, underscore the intricate interplay between artificial light and perceptual distortions. Shortly after light bulbs were implemented the largest reported increase of unidentified flying objects began. \n\nThe light bulb played an enormous role in the beginning of the disconnect with nature. \nIt was quickly followed by the advent of the automobile, heralding unprecedented mobility and accessibility, has indelibly reshaped human-nature interactions and potentially exacerbated the trajectory of Nature Deficit Disorder. The unparalleled convenience and velocity facilitated by cars have diminished the imperative for outdoor physical exertion, leading to a pronounced shift towards prolonged car commutes and indoor engagements at the expense of leisurely outdoor pursuits. \n\nConsequently, the protracted vehicular commutes and augmented indoor lifestyles engender a perceptible disconnect from nature, underscoring the imperative for individuals to recalibrate and allocate time for outdoor engagements to stave off the symptomatic manifestations associated with Nature Deficit Disorder. Despite the myriad advantages of automobiles in enhancing transportation efficacy, a conscientious effort to balance indoor pursuits with outdoor activities remains imperative to nurture a symbiotic relationship with nature and obviate the adverse effects of disconnect. \n\nThe advent of the radio marked a paradigm shift in information dissemination and entertainment consumption, affording individuals novel avenues for engagement without necessitating outdoor ventures. While radio listening engendered heightened indoor stays, it concurrently offered a surrogate for outdoor knowledge and vicarious nature engagement. The subsequent leap to visual media heralded by television elicited a seismic impact on human-nature dynamics, primarily accentuated by the sedentary proclivities and indoor-focused nature of television consumption. \n\nThe proliferation of television programming, offering a plethora of entertainment options within domestic confines, has catalyzed a perceptible shift in leisure preferences, with many opting for indoor TV consumption over outdoor recreations. This prolonged exposure to television content, often distanced from the authentic portrayal of nature, can further exacerbate the disconnect from the natural realm, potentiate symptomatic rubrics emblematic of Nature Deficit Disorder, and engender an attenuated appreciation for the veracity of nature. \n\nThe widening schism between quotidian existence and nature portends a disconcerting transformation, underpinning a pernicious attrition of attention spans and focus. These cognitive deficits bear pronounced repercussions on autonomy and independence, connoting a precarious erosion of liberty contingent on sustained cognitive engagement. The disconcerting narrative of dwindling focus heralds a poignant metaphorical captivity, emblematic of a veiled entrapment obscured by the semblance of freedom, bereft of the cognizance to emancipate oneself from invisible shackles. \n\nThe indispensability of focus and attention span for holistic well-being and autonomy is predicated on multifaceted underpinnings: \n\n1. Productivity: Robust focus and unwavering attention are pivotal for optimizing productivity across manifold domains, encompassing professional endeavors, scholastic pursuits, and quotidian tasks, facilitating task completion with efficacy and precision. \n\n2. Learning and Memory: \nThe foundational bedrock of learning and memory is intricately interwoven with focus and attention span, underpinning information assimilation, retention, and cognitive connectivity to promote academic and professional maturation. \n\n3. Problem-Solving and Decision-Making:\nThe cognitive essence of robust attention capacitates enhanced problem-solving acuity and decision-making prowess, enabling an adept analysis of disparate options, scrutiny of salient information, and evaluation of potential outcomes to foster informed and efficacious decision-making. \n\n4. Independence: Sustained focus and attention are linchpins for independence, galvanizing task adherence, accountability, and discerning decision-making sans perpetual oversight, thereby nurturing self-reliance and autonomy across diverse spheres. \n\n5. Emotional Regulation: Focus and attention span are pivotal in shaping emotional regulation and mental well-being, empowering individuals to navigate stress, contend with challenges, and foster emotional resilience through the cultivation of adaptive coping mechanisms. \n\nIn synthesis, the resilience and vibrancy of focus and attention span proffer an essential scaffold for cognitive acuity, learning proficiency, problem-solving finesse, decision-making efficacy, independence cultivation, and emotional well-being. Enriching and nurturing these cognitive faculties augurs a salient enhancement in overall quality of life, propelling individuals towards self-actualization, and fostering thriving efficacy across a myriad of endeavors. \n\nThe metaphorical interplay between human cognition and the natural world unveils a riveting narrative of entrapment and liberation, where the ephemeral veil of freedom shrouds the invisible shackles of dwindling attention spans. This disconcerting dichotomy heralds a profound disconnection from the innate symbiosis with nature, triggering a cascade of cognitive deficits that imperil autonomy and liberty. \n\nDelving deeper into the multifaceted tapestry of focus and attention span, we unravel a rich tapestry that underscores their indispensable role in optimizing productivity, fortifying learning and memory, honing problem-solving acumen, nurturing independence, and fostering emotional resilience. These cognitive faculties serve as the bedrock upon which our holistic well-being and self-actualization are predicated, propelling us towards a realm of thriving efficacy and profound cognitive acuity. \n\nIn a world besieged by incessant distractions and the siren call of digital enticements, reclaiming and nurturing our focus and attention span emerges as a transformative act of self-empowerment. If our attention span continues to diminish and our disconnect with nature increases we will see\u00a0 freedom become a relic of the past, being human will amount to nothing more than being a product.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If A Tree Falls \n\nA very old yet enduring question that most of us all think of at a point is are we free or is everything determined? If we are free then is our entire existence simply random decisions made which are all based on nothing? The quantum answer would be that we could be free and then again we couldn't. Just as our decisions could possibly be for a defined reason, on the other side of the coin our decisions could have no meaning what so ever, regardless both ideas are no more than possibilities. Probability is for certain the foundation which the quantum house is built on, in a quantum verse it's more than poetic to say anything is possible, it's a literal representation. \n\nWhen growing up I often heard the question that if a tree falls and nobody is around does it make a sound, this is a question in which the subject is of a quantum nature. The answer to the question is far from a yes or no, however shallow it may seem, I can assure you that you're in deep because the tree might make a sound and it might not. \n\nTherefore I ask you to be like John and go into the woods for a moment. The power of observation can not be underestimated as it's relative to each possibility. As we walk via the woods we see the beautiful bifurcation(quantum manifold) of the universe all around us, remember\u00a0 to keep this mind. Imagine that as we walk we are blindfolded and have earplugs in so we will not hear or see a tree fall. So forget the idea of a noise, even if a noise occurs we can't hear it. \n\nAs we walk, we are unable to see or hear but just like a wave we can feel our momentum moving forward (wave) through the woods. The only way you will be to tell if a tree has fallen is if your close enough to feel the momentum of the tree(wave). If your close enough you will feel the energy of the impact of the fallen tree surge up via your feet as it travels through the circuit of clay. As the momentum resonates via your body(also clay/conductor). I can tell you that even though I didn't see it or hear I know a tree has fallen. \n\nNow let's take the same situation and ask if it's possible for a tree to fall within a couple of feet of me except I feel nothing, I've also took off the blindfold and the ear plugs yet I also don't hear anything or see a tree on the ground.\u00a0 Basically if a tree falls in the woods and im next to that tree does it make a sound? \n\nOnce again I don't see this as a yes or no solution, it too would be a big maybe. In this case the tree falls and as it's on it's way to the ground it's propped up by a tree next to it, the tree has broken apart yet it doesn't fall to the ground, it's fell without making noise and it's also not laying on the ground. Now lets put our blinders and plugs back on and this time the tree falls all the way to the ground except I can't feel its momentum and I'm only a foot away from where it lays. \n\nThis time I was standing in place, however when the tree hits the ground I'm simultaneously jumping into the air,(behaving as a wave) as Im in the air the energy of the falling tree has traveled under me prior to me landing on my feet. Once I land and take another step I trip over the tree as I am now behaving as a partical.\u00a0 Now let's say we go via the same situation except this time I collide with the falling tree in mid air(both myself and the tree behaving as a wave). As me and the tree collide I feel my momentum be either increased or decreased according to the angle in which we collided, however as I'm still blind and deaf I'm\u00a0 unable to tell you if a tree just fell into me or if I ran into a rock. \n\nNow let's say once again we are blind and deaf and as we move along, however this time the tree hasn't fell. Instead the tree is by the wind as it bends enough to reach over and tap us on the head. As I feel the contact on my head I have no way of telling what just happened but I do know what it most likely is. If you take any of the prior examples and remove the plugs or blindfold everything changes according to how your sensing it(observing). \n\nWhat im trying to explain is that the degree of observation is as much a factor as the observation itself, basically are you looking out of the corner of your eyes or maybe your peeking through your blindfold. Either way you look at it the observation by itself is one thing but the degree of observation can be many things.\u00a0 The next time you hear someone ask that old question if a tree falls you can for certain say, maybe. The degree of observation is completely relevant to any behavior in it's entirety. \n\nNow let's leave the woods and go to the yahtzee board. You are fixing to play in a yahtzee tournament with a twist. Nobody will roll any dice, every roll of the dice has been rolled for\u00a0 you and recorded the night before. You simply set down out the board and the numbers which were already recorded are given to you to. Every roll of the dice has already been made so it must mean that the tournament is determined, so everyone is destined to win or lose, right? Once again don't expect it to be as simple as yes or no,\u00a0 it's a maybe they are a loser and maybe they're not. \n\nThe numbers are already in place but what will determine the winner has nothing to do with the prior rolls of the dice, the only thing that matters is at one point you enter the game. What will determine if you win or lose is relative to the moment of the game in correlation\u00a0 to when you started playing. The first\u00a0 few rolls which were recorded may give you a yahtzee just as the last few rolls may just give you a pair. Say your betting on the game since you got all the numbers for each roll of the dice, even with that information you still will not be able to predict the winner based only on the numbers, you also need to know which players will get each roll and the order in which they make their rolls. \n\nYour only observing so you have no control over who goes when and therefore you are clueless on who might win, even though you have a lot of information and can tell every roll of the dice you still have no idea who will get each number.\u00a0 Even if each player knows each number they will get they still don't know how the others may use their numbers, that will be different for each person as they each look differently at the same thing. For example, you and the person next to you are both given a pair. You take the pair as the person next to you with the same numbers goes for three of a kind instead. You end up with the pair as the other person ends up with nothing. \n\nIn conclusion I hope this lights your imagination and helps\u00a0 you reconsider your ideas of freedom and determinism as they are much more complicated than meets the eye. The next time someone asks you about\u00a0 the tree falling, tell them it may just as it may not. Also remember that even with tons of information you will always certainly be uncertain about the future. Even if everything we do is predetermined we still have a freedom to view our determined experiences anyway we wish. That's how it works when you simultaneously experience freedom and bonage. Therefore when you concern yourself about how others observe the life you are experiencing wouldn't you be surrendering your freedom? If so then not caring about what others think is more important than we ever thought it could be.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Noah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Noah's ark \nIn Roaring seas below \nFrom above pours Gods Greiving soul.\nWilllld, as the garden.\nIn the jungle, that we roam. \n\nAmidst those waves\na vessel stands strong, \nbearing the weight of divine grief.

Here are a few options to consider: \n\n1. Piezoelectric Materials: One way to capture kinetic energy from walking is by using piezoelectric materials. These materials generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress or strain. By embedding piezoelectric materials in shoes or flooring, the impact of each step can be converted into electrical energy. \n\n2. Wireless Capacitor Charging: To make the energy harvesting process convenient and wireless, a capacitor system could be employed. Capacitors store electrical energy and can release it on demand. By linking the piezoelectric system to a wireless capacitor, the harvested energy could be stored and later used to power various devices. \n\n3. Energy Harvesting Insoles: An alternative approach is to develop specialized insoles that incorporate piezoelectric materials. These insoles can be inserted into regular shoes and capture energy with every step. The harvested energy can then be wirelessly transmitted to a capacitor system for storage or directly used to power small wearable devices. \n\n4. Wireless Power Transfer: Energy harvesting from walking could also involve wireless power transfer. By using electromagnetic induction or resonant coupling technologies, the kinetic energy from walking can be wirelessly transferred to nearby devices. This eliminates the need for physical connections and allows for efficient energy transfer. \n\n5. Integration with Smart Grids: Another possibility is to incorporate the energy harvesting system into existing power grids. By connecting the wireless capacitor system to smart grid infrastructure, the captured energy can be seamlessly transmitted and utilized for various purposes within homes or buildings. \n\nThe kinetic energy generated by a moving vehicle can indeed be harnessed and utilized in various ways. Here are a few options to capture the kinetic energy of a vehicle: \n\n1. Regenerative Braking: In hybrid and electric vehicles, regenerative braking systems can capture and convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion into electrical energy. When the vehicle brakes, the energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat is instead used to charge the vehicle's battery. \n\n2. Roadway Energy Harvesting: Another approach is to capture the kinetic energy from vehicles directly through the roadways they travel on. Technologies like piezoelectric materials or electromagnetic induction can be embedded in the road surface. As vehicles pass over these sections, the kinetic energy from their weight and motion can be converted into electrical energy. \n\n3. Flywheel Systems: Flywheel systems can capture and store the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle. The system consists of a high-speed rotating flywheel that is connected to the wheels or axles of the vehicle. When the vehicle decelerates or brakes, the flywheel spins faster, storing the captured kinetic energy. This stored energy can then be used to assist in acceleration or power various systems in the vehicle. \n\n4. Energy-Generating Suspension: The suspension system of a vehicle experiences constant movement as it drives over bumps, uneven roads, and imperfections. Energy-generating suspension systems can harvest this kinetic energy by converting the vertical motion of the suspension into electrical energy using mechanisms like piezoelectric or electromagnetic devices. \n\n5. Wind Turbines: Some vehicles, especially larger ones like trucks or buses, generate significant airflow while traveling. By integrating small wind turbines or wind-capturing devices into their design, the kinetic energy of the airflow created by the vehicle's motion can generate electricity. \n\nNatural Kinetics \n\nTo estimate the kinetic energy distribution of a 150-pound individual walking 2000 steps on an even grade, we can make some assumptions and calculations based on average values. \n\n1. Average Stride Length: Let's assume an average stride length of approximately 2.5 feet or 0.76 meters for the individual walking on an even grade. \n\n2. Vertical Displacement: When walking on an even grade, there is minimal vertical displacement or change in elevation. For simplicity, we can assume negligible vertical displacement. \n\n3. Walking Efficiency: Walking efficiency refers to the proportion of energy expended during walking that is converted into kinetic energy. Let's assume an average walking efficiency of 70% for the individual. \n\nNow, let's calculate the kinetic energy distribution based on these assumptions: \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total distance covered by the individual during 2000 steps:\nTotal distance = Number of steps * Stride Length\nTotal distance = 2000 steps * 0.76 meters/step\nTotal distance = 1520 meters \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total work done by the individual:\nTotal work = Total distance * Weight * Gravity\nTotal work = 1520 meters * 68.04 kg (converted weight) * 9.8 m/s^2\nTotal work = 1,055,724.8 joules \n\nStep 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy achieved:\nTotal kinetic energy = Total work * Walking Efficiency\nTotal kinetic energy = 1,055,724.8 joules * 0.7\nTotal kinetic energy = 738,007.36 joules \n\nThis calculation provides an estimate of the total kinetic energy achieved by a 150-pound individual walking 2000 steps on an even grade. However, it's important to remember that these values are approximate and can vary based on individual characteristics and walking patterns.\n\n\n1. Charging a Smartphone: A typical smartphone battery has a capacity of around 2,000-4,000 milliampere-hours (mAh), equivalent to approximately 7,200,000 - 14,400,000 joules. The estimated kinetic energy of 738,007.36 joules would be sufficient to charge a smartphone multiple times, depending on the phone's battery capacity and efficiency losses during charging. \n\n2. Powering a Light Bulb: A standard LED light bulb typically consumes around 5 - 20 watts of power. Assuming a conservative value of 10 watts, the estimated kinetic energy would power the light bulb for around 73,800 - 147,600 seconds, or roughly 20 - 41 hours. \n\n3. Running a Laptop: Laptops generally consume between 30 - 100 watts of power depending on their configuration and usage. Taking an average value of 65 watts, the estimated kinetic energy could power a laptop for approximately 11,350 - 22,700 seconds, or about 3 - 6 hours. \n\nIf we consider the estimated kinetic energy of 738,007.36 joules, it would be sufficient to power LED lights for a significant duration, especially if we take into account energy-efficient LED bulbs. With an average power consumption of around 10 watts for LED lights, the estimated energy could potentially power LED lights for approximately 73,800 - 147,600 seconds or around 20 - 41 hours. \n\nKeep in mind that this estimation assumes ideal conditions and does not factor in losses in the energy conversion process or other inefficiencies. Additionally, it is important to consider the variability in the amount of energy captured and harnessed from walking, as it depends on factors such as walking speed, gait, and the efficiency of the energy harvesting technology. \n\nWhile kinetic energy harvesting from walking can contribute to powering LED lights, it is important to pursue efficient energy harvesting systems and consider supplemental energy sources to ensure continuous illumination. \n\nTo estimate the number of nuclearpower plants that would be equivalent to harnessing the kinetic energy generated by 1 billion people during a 2000 step day, we'll follow the assumptions and calculations from the previous context. \n\nAssuming all 1 billion individuals have shoes capable of capturing and distributing their kinetic energy and share the same weight of 150 lbs (approximately 68.04 kg), we can proceed with the calculations. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total kinetic energy of one individual per 2000 steps:\nUsing the previous calculation, the estimated kinetic energy per individual for 2000 steps is approximately 738,007.36 joules. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy from 1 billion people:\nTotal kinetic energy = Energy per individual * Number of individuals\nTotal kinetic energy = 738,007.36 joules * 1,000,000,000 people\nTotal kinetic energy = 738,007,360,000,000 joules \n\nStep 3: Compare to the energy produced by a nuclear power plant:\nNuclear power plant capacities can vary significantly, but for comparison, let's consider the average capacity of a modern nuclear power plant, which is around 1,000 megawatts or 1,000,000,000 watts. \n\nStep 4: Convert the kinetic energy to watts:\nSince 1 watt is equal to 1 joule per second, we can calculate the equivalent power output:\nPower output = Total kinetic energy / time\nAssuming the time to be one day (86,400 seconds):\nPower output = 738,007,360,000,000 joules / 86,400 seconds\nPower output \u2248 8,527,036,296 watts \n\nStep 5: Determine the number of nuclear power plants:\nDividing the power output by the capacity of a nuclear power plant gives us:\nNumber of power plants = Power output / Power plant capacity\nNumber of power plants \u2248 8,527,036,296 watts / 1,000,000,000 watts\nNumber of power plants \u2248 8.5 \n\nTherefore, harnessing the kinetic energy generated by 1 billion individuals during a 2000 step day would be approximately equivalent to the power output of about 8.5 nuclear power plants. Please bear in mind that these calculations are approximate and do not account for various factors like energy conversion efficiency or variations in nuclear power plant capacities.\nDetermining the economic feasibility of harnessing and utilizing the kinetic energy generated by 1 billion people through their shoes is a complex task that requires consideration of various factors. Here are some key points to consider in assessing the economic feasibility: \n\n1. Cost of Energy Harvesting Technology: The cost of developing, manufacturing, and distributing shoes capable of capturing and distributing kinetic energy would play a significant role in determining the economic feasibility. The technology used, such as piezoelectric materials or energy-capturing mechanisms, would need to be cost-effective and scalable. \n\n2. Infrastructure Implementation: Building the necessary infrastructure to capture and distribute the kinetic energy on a large scale would require significant investment. This includes embedding the energy-harvesting technologies in public spaces, walkways, and roads, as well as establishing the distribution and storage systems for the harvested energy. \n\n3. Energy Conversion Efficiency: The efficiency of converting kinetic energy into usable electrical energy would impact the economic viability. Higher conversion efficiencies would result in a greater output of usable energy, thus enhancing the economic feasibility by maximizing the energy return. \n\n4. Maintenance and Upkeep Costs: Factoring in the costs of regular maintenance, inspection, and replacements of the energy-harvesting devices and infrastructure is crucial. Ensuring the longevity and reliability of the technology would help mitigate long-term expenses. \n\n5. Scale of Deployment: The economic feasibility would depend on the actual adoption and participation of 1 billion individuals. Achieving mass adoption would require extensive marketing, awareness campaigns, and financial incentives to motivate individuals to use the energy.", "[Available] Google Drive PDF books thread (part-47)!+ Accepting requests every day * **If you find your book in the thread below, send the book number via Reddit chat**\n* **all books have the latest version as well in multiple editions**\n* **Books (pdf) sent via Google -Drive link**\n* **UPVote this\u00a0post if you find it useful**\n\nPlease find the list below:\n\n6287.

Stanley Eitzen & Maxine Baca Zinn & Kelly Eitzen Smith", "American Reindustrialization: A Big Trend That Could Significantly Impact the World Economy For much of the 20th century, the United States was the world's preeminent industrial power, driving economic growth, innovation, and middle-class prosperity. However, the past few decades have seen a steady erosion of the nation's manufacturing base. The shift toward a service-oriented economy, coupled with the offshoring of manufacturing jobs, has hollowed out industrial communities, and contributed to the decline of the middle class.\n\nToday, reindustrialization is not just an option but a necessity. But what does it really mean? Reindustrialization is the process of revitalizing and expanding a nation's industrial sector by modernizing infrastructure, bringing manufacturing back from overseas, and investing in advanced technologies. It aims to boost economic growth, create jobs, and enhance national security by reducing reliance on foreign production.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly those centered in China, and geopolitical tensions have heightened concerns about national security and economic sovereignty. The rise of economic nationalism and the need for sustainable growth are driving the US to rethink its approach to manufacturing. In this post I try to explore the historical context, driving factors, challenges, and potential impacts of America's reindustrialization efforts.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nPost-World War II, the US emerged as the leading industrial power, with manufacturing as the backbone of the economy. Giants like General Motors, Ford, and Boeing symbolized American strength and ingenuity. Manufacturing accounted for nearly 30% of GDP, and well-paying jobs provided a pathway to the American dream, fostering a thriving middle class.\n\nFrom the late 20th century onward, US manufacturing began to decline. Globalization and China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse led many American companies to shift production overseas to reduce costs. Technological advancements and the rise of a knowledge-based economy further contributed to this decline. By 2020, manufacturing accounted for just 11% of GDP, leaving many industrial communities in economic distress.\n\n**Factors Driving Reindustrialization**\n\nTechnological Advancements: A new wave of technological innovation is reshaping the manufacturing landscape, making US manufacturing more competitive. Automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced technologies like 3D printing are reducing costs and increasing efficiency. These technologies are revitalizing traditional industries and creating new ones, such as advanced manufacturing and green technologies. For instance, 3D printing is revolutionizing the aerospace and automotive sectors with unprecedented precision and speed.\n\nGovernment Policy: Federal and state policies are crucial in promoting reindustrialization. The last couple of US administrations have made this a key pillar of their economic strategy, for e.g., the CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to boost domestic semiconductor production. This has led to significant investments from companies like Intel and TSMC in new US manufacturing facilities. Additionally, tariffs, tax incentives, and infrastructure investments are creating a favorable environment for US manufacturing.\n\nShale Revolution: The Shale Revolution has further bolstered American industrial capabilities by making the US the world\u2019s largest producer of precursor materials essential for petrochemicals. This abundance of natural gas and oil has been pivotal in the first phase of reindustrialization, providing the raw materials needed for heavy manufacturing. The shale revolution has also shown that new-age manufacturing in the US can be highly successful.\n\nOther factors: Rising labor costs abroad and a desire for greater control over supply chains are key drivers. Producing goods closer to the consumer market reduces shipping costs, shortens lead times, and enhances responsiveness to consumer demands. Recent successes, such as advanced apparel manufacturing facilities and semiconductor investments, highlight reshoring\u2019s potential to revitalize American manufacturing.\n\n**Workforce Impacts**\n\nReindustrialization has the potential to create millions of jobs across various sectors, including traditional manufacturing and emerging industries like green energy and advanced manufacturing. This expansion could significantly boost employment, particularly in regions hit hardest by the manufacturing decline. Innovation hubs and tech clusters could also generate high-paying, skilled jobs, fostering economic growth and community revitalization.\n\nA significant challenge however will be the need for a skilled blue-collar workforce. Over the last several decades, the US has shifted toward white-collar jobs, with many workers in the service and technology sectors. Reindustrialization demands a strong need for blue-collar workers requiring specialized skills in manufacturing and engineering. Addressing this involves retraining the current workforce and attracting young talent to manufacturing, which has struggled with a perception problem. This could be a major issue, especially if automation or AI is unable to have as big as impact as hoped.\n\n**Other considerations**\n\nThe reindustrialization of the United States has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits. By revitalizing the manufacturing sector, the US will create millions of new jobs, boost GDP growth, and revitalize economically depressed regions. According to some estimates, this could add a few trillion $$s to GDP over the next 20 years.\n\nReindustrialization holds the promise of reducing income inequality and supporting middle-class families. Manufacturing jobs have traditionally been a source of stable, well-paying employment for millions of Americans. By bringing these jobs back to the US, reindustrialization can help reverse the trend of wage stagnation and provide new opportunities for workers across the country.\n\nAs the US rebuilds its industrial footprint, sustainability could be a key factor. By adopting green manufacturing practices and investing in clean energy, the US can reduce carbon emissions, promote energy efficiency, and lead the global transition to a low-carbon economy. The development of green technologies, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, is not only good for the environment but also represents a significant growth opportunity for US industry.\n\nAmerican reindustrialization will have significant global implications. By creating jobs, driving innovation, and promoting sustainable practices, the US is on a path to further economic growth. However, addressing workforce challenges is key; relying solely on technology is insufficient. The US must focus on developing the right workforce through enhanced education, training programs, and potentially revised immigration policies to attract and prepare skilled workers. As the US reclaims its industrial strength, it will have a profound impact on the global economic landscape.\n\nAmericanReindustrialization #USManufacturing #EconomicRenewal #IndustrialRevival #Reshoring #GreenManufacturing #JobCreation #TechInnovation #SustainableIndustry #FutureOfManufacturing #EconomicGrowth #MadeInUSA #IndustrialRevolution #EconomicTrends #ManufacturingJobs #InfrastructureInvestment #GlobalEconomy #CleanEnergy #WorkforceDevelopment #AdvancedManufacturing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwbs5uj36rjd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df196b9f821946d400773d4fab41214fb65eb88a", "Has anyone gone over this?

Simple Moving Average Outfits are the core operations of the United States Equity Markets' blackbox systems. The following information examines the AI-assisted decision-making processes that effectively create all principal market behaviors. This information details the specific tools utilized by the largest aggressive wealth conglomerates, with sophisticated trading divisions, to provide liquidity, enable domestic and international market efficiency, and function in a manner intended to manipulate the market. It is crucial to recognize that the data presented here directly informs global financial strategies, rewards long-term market participants, and is the fulcrum of the American financial system. This strategic integration ensures that every significant market action is underpinned by data-driven, algorithmically enhanced decision-making, that reflect the sophistication and precision of modern financial engineering.\n\n## Overview\n\nSMA outfits fundamentally dictate when and where the largest equity managers direct liquidity, thus operating the flow of capital that shapes the entire market structure. The precision and application of SMA outfits are critical, considering every Stock Market transaction is influenced by these configurations. Clear and actionable signals with incredible precision ensure that all market participants can operate with full awareness of market conditions, which quite literally forge market efficiency.\n\nFor those new to financial markets, it is an extreme leap to understand the magnitude of capital that is mobilized through public equity markets. These \"outfits\" are not optional elements, instead are core components that are what have prompted effective markets since the start of automated quotations in the NASDAQ. This repository should serve to set the stage for layman, academics, mathematicians, quantitative researches, and regulatory bodies to have full unabridged access to the global financial system catalyzed by financiers of the United States of America.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis research relies on high-precision data sourced primarily from desktop Lightspeed (brokerage) and Webull platforms, both of which are known for their near-total accuracy in data provision. However, periodic data inconsistencies have been observed with Webull, notably on March 18th, 2024, which involved data discrepancies potentially linked to cache errors. Lightspeed Broker has consistently delivered accurate data barring isolated incidents directly attributed to errors from the NYSE or NASDAQ. To manage and store the extensive volume of historical price action data required for this analysis, InfluxDB was employed due to its robust data handling capabilities. The InfluxDB system was chosen for its efficiency in storing time-series data, allowing for rapid queries and retrieval necessary for the rapid real-time nature of equity market analysis. This setup ensures that all data used is normalized and processed with the highest standards of accuracy, serving as the backbone for all subsequent analytical tasks.\n\nAll data handling and trading practices detailed within this research strictly comply with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws, including GDPR, SEC regulations, and other applicable standards, ensuring integrity and legality in all operational aspects.\n\n### Data Handling and Analysis Framework\n\nThe SMA calculation engine relies on a dual-source input system, incorporating real-time and historical market data from **Lightspeed** and **Webull**, two renowned trading platforms known for their precision and reliability in data provision.\n\n#### Data Sources and Integration\n\n- **Lightspeed**: Known for its robustness and favored by professional traders, Lightspeed provides high-frequency data that includes every trade, quote, and order book change. This data is critical for developing real-time SMA calculations that can respond instantaneously to market movements.\n- **Webull**: Offers comprehensive market data that includes not only transactional information but also extensive metadata on trading instruments, which is vital for contextual analysis in SMA calculations.\n- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: This format is used for its flexibility and ease of integration with web technologies. JSON structures allow for a detailed representation of nested data, which is particularly useful for encapsulating the various attributes of market data, such as timestamps, prices, volumes, and metadata.\n- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: This format is employed for its simplicity and efficiency in handling large datasets that are typical in historical data analysis. CSV formats are particularly advantageous for batch processing and long-term historical analysis, where data manipulation and storage efficiency are paramount.\n\n#### Pre-processing for SMA Calculation Readiness\n\nTo maintain the highest standards of data quality and consistency, the following pre-processing steps are implemented:\n\n- **Data Cleansing**: The initial step involves scrubbing the data to remove or correct data anomalies that could skew SMA calculations. This includes:\n  - Removing any records with null or missing values in critical fields such as timestamps or prices.\n  - Identifying and correcting outliers that fall outside of a statistically reasonable range, possibly due to data entry errors or system glitches.\n\n- **Timestamp Normalization**: Given the global nature of financial markets, data from various sources may come with different time zones. All timestamps are converted to a uniform timezone (EST) to maintain consistency across the dataset. Additionally, timestamps are normalized to the highest resolution needed for real-time trading decisions, typically to the millisecond, to ensure precise alignment in time-series analysis.\n\n#### Filtering Incomplete Data\n- Entries that do not meet the complete information criteria, such as those missing essential metadata like trade volume or instrument type, are filtered out to ensure the reliability of the SMA outputs. This includes entries with zero, negative, or unrealistically low prices that might indicate data errors or placeholder values used during data entry mishaps.\n- Data entries that lack timestamp information, which are critical for placing the price in a temporal context are omitted.\n- Missing crucial metadata like stock ticker symbols, market identifiers, or other descriptors that prevent clear association with specific trading instruments are adjusted.\n- Sudden spikes or drops in price or volume that do not align with known market behaviors or news events, suggesting potential data errors that deviate significantly from a moving average or median value and do not correlate with market events are omitted.\n\n#### Data Consistency Checks\n- Consistency checks are performed to ensure that data across different sources aligns correctly. For example, price data from Lightspeed is cross-verified with Webull data for the same instruments at the same timestamps. Discrepancies are logged and investigated to maintain a high integrity data set.\n- Identical entries recorded multiple times due to data entry errors or system glitches. These duplicates can artificially inflate the importance of a single data point within the SMA calculation.\n\n##### Error Handling\n- Robust error handling mechanisms are built to address data feed interruptions or anomalies dynamically. This includes fallback procedures to retrieve data from alternative sources or to use the last known good data point as a placeholder until the feed is restored.\n\n#### Data Integration\n- Data from various sources is integrated into a unified format within a staging area before final storage in InfluxDB. This involves aligning data fields, both harmonizing and isolating data formats, and consolidating records to prepare for efficient querying and analysis.\n\nA SMA calculation engine ensures that the data fed into the system is of the highest quality, providing accurate market analysis. The SMA calculations support both scalability and adaptability for Data Processing.\n \n#### Data Processing\n\nData processing is the core operational phase where raw market data is transformed into actionable insights through SMA calculations and trading signal generation. This stage is crucial for implementing trading strategies based on the calculated SMA values.\n\n#### Computational Algorithms\n- **SMA Calculations**: Implement algorithms to calculate Simple Moving Averages over various time windows as specified by the user or system requirements. This involves computing the average of stock prices over a set number of past data points continuously as new data comes in.\n- **Signal Generation**: Develop algorithms that analyze SMA lines for typical trading signals such as crossovers. A signal is generated when a short-term SMA crosses above (buy signal) or below (sell signal) a long-term SMA, indicating potential market movements.\n- **Algorithm Complexity**: Manage the complexity of these algorithms to handle large datasets without degrading performance, ensuring that calculations can keep pace with real-time data flow.\n\n#### Performance Optimization\n- **Resource Management**: Optimize the use of computational resources to process data efficiently, minimizing latency, which is essential in high-frequency trading environments.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel processing techniques where feasible, especially for computationally intensive tasks like real-time SMA recalculations across multiple instruments.\n- **Caching Strategies**: Utilize advanced caching mechanisms to store interim computational results, reducing redundancy in calculations and speeding up response times for frequently requested data in order to implement real time executions.\n\n### Integrating SMA Outfits with OHLC Data\n\nTo operationalize SMA outfits effectively, our algorithms integrate cleaned and processed OHLC data to detect specific patterns aligned with predefined SMA configurations. This integration is pivotal for identifying trade opportunities based on real-time market behaviors.\n\n#### Frequency Detection and Trigger Mechanisms\n\n- **Frequency Detection**: Algorithms scan OHLC data for frequency patterns that align with the SMA outfits, identifying precision trading operations that have a historical repertoire in real time.\n- **Trigger Mechanism**: Upon detecting a historically operated pattern, advanced arbitrage outfit detection systems automatically trigger buying and/or selling protocols, executing trades based on precise, real-time analysis of SMA, OHLC, Timeframe data intersections.\n\nBy refining computational algorithms and optimizing performance, the data processing stage ensures that trading strategies based on SMA calculations are both reliable and timely, capable of operating effectively in real time market environments.\n\n## Background and Research\nThe exploration of the significance of the integer Three in public equities initiated a year-long academic inquiry, encompassing areas such as quantum mechanics, cryptography, mathematical abstractions, and logic. This journey was informed by the foundational contributions of Alan Turing to current mathematical pedagogy. In the course of this scholarly pursuit, the research encountered the seminal works of Edward Waring and David Hilbert, two mathematicians whose theories have profoundly influenced the field of mathematics and computer science. It was within this context that the researcher discovered the conjecture known as David Hilbert's Waring's Problem.\n\nWARING'S PROBLEM is a profound natural number theory conjecture. In layman terms it explores proof that every number can be broken down into a certain type of smaller number. More importantly, if every number can be expressed using a limited set of patterns. That is where you get the integers 19/37/73/143/279/548 that, for the sake of simplicity apparently are the six integers global wealth operators have elected to use as one of the SMA outfits. This effective research, in conjunction with heuristic (trial based, rule based frameworks) search and brute-force (systematic probing of combinations) application of Waring's Problem integers, evolved into a method of empirical optimization that further refined my investigative approach.\n\nGiven my academic background in sociology I wasn't taken aback to learn that the machinations of the U.S. financial project are meant to be complicated. The facade of finance is premised on the reality that the Elite, Capitalist beneficiaries, Public who work to live and contribute to an IRA/Pension/401K/Taxes, and International Subjects rely on this sophisticated system. My research focused immediately on identifying the technical foundation of the public equity markets, recognizing it as a multi-millionaire, multi-billionaire, and multi-trillion dollar economic growth and exploitation project.\n\nDetailed below are the procedures and selection process governed by exceptionally intricate parameters. These parameters, despite their complexity, facilitate straightforward visualization, documentation, and real-time recording. The proof here is what has garnered the public's reception. Public equities are a product of a multidisciplinary combination of data science, software engineering integrating Data Acquisition from real time & historical market data, broker API integration, & real time selections.\n\nThere is a more singular breakdown that should be addressed and asserted. Consider the SMA outfits as singular and explicit proof that, backed by ten of thousands of instances of real time data recently made public, under critical scrutiny by agencies of intelligence and regulatory bodies, points to the financial ecosystem plainly reflecting our socio-cultural construct. Consider that any understanding of wealth is tied to symbols and meaning of which we as people imbue in numbers. While the selection of specific SMA parameters may be technically arbitrary, it is the precision and consistency of these chosen configurations that have been proven to facilitate and document substantial wealth transfer via the financial markets. These SMA configurations are chosen by intelligence agencies to add complexity and flexibility, allowing only well-informed and strategic financial firms to benefit significantly and collaboratively. \n\n\n\n## Technical Explanation\nSimple Moving Average (SMA) outfits are sets of predetermined SMAs that institutions with aggressive trading divisions use as triggers for executing trades in high volume liquid trading vehicles (stocks). A Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average OHLC (open, high, low, close) prices, over a certain number of periods. Each outfit consists of multiple SMAs with different time periods.  By employing SMA outfits effectively on multiple vehicles, large financial institutions with aggressive trading divisions maximize on every singular point shift in the public equity markets. Since these institutions manage vast sums of money, their trades move the market in the direction of their trades, effectively redistributing wealth to aggressive trading divisions and eventually long-term market participants.\n\n### Parameter Limitation\nThe parameter set for SMA outfits is strictly maintained between 1 and 999 to preserve these benefits across all trading platforms and scenarios. This boundary not only supports a structured and simplified analysis framework but also ensures that all market participants can engage with the data in a clear and organized manner. Standardizing SMA parameters within this range ensures uniformity across different markets and asset classes, allowing trading divisions and algorithms to apply consistent operations whether trading stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. This uniformity simplifies the development and implementation of automated trading systems, reducing complexity and enhancing reliability. Algorithms from advanced trading divisions benefit from a standardized approach, which supports more straightforward programming, rigorous testing, and effective execution of trading. By avoiding extremes the data remains relevant and actionable without succumbing to redundancy or irrelevance.\n\n### Executive Definitions\n\nThis section provides detailed definitions of key terms and strategies used in the context of SMA operations and trading algorithms. Understanding these definitions will aid in understanding the behavior of the market as directly influenced by SMA outfits.\n\n#### Precision Buying Algorithm\nA **Precision Buying Algorithm** is performed by advanced trading systems that leverage both historical market data and real-time conditions, and sophisticated statistical analyses. The primary function of Precision Buying Algorithms are to stimulate capital in and out of the public equity markets by rigorously analyzing patterns and specific price points within Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) market data. The core mechanism of these algorithms involves the detection of precise market conditions triggered by specific Simple Moving Average (SMA) outfit selections. This occurs particularly after a market drawdown, where firms with leading algorithm detection tools identify a collaborative and historically relevant arbitrage opportunity. This operation ensures continuity in market conditions that aggressive trading divisions exploit for sustained engagement or the maximization of returns through precisely times intervention. In practice, a precision buying algorithm activates when an arbitrage detection system identifies a precision OHLC relationship within a singular timeframe, singular equity, and singular SMA Outfit that has been historically or statistically significant following an SMA-induced drawdown. This SMA selection serves as a critical signal that conditions are primed for a profitable buying operation. The algorithm then executes buy orders at these meticulously calculated moments from the second of its selection, in order to capitalize on rapid price movement, thus optimizing capital gains. The operational success of these algorithms is fundamentally reliant on extreme liquidity in the vehicle, the system's ability to discern and act upon these finely-tuned market cues, ensuring high precision in the timing and execution of the budgeted selection. This precision in targeting exact price points ensures the reliability of public equity markets. The technical efficacy achieved through precise SMA outfit detection and historical operations ensures that trading division maximize from algorithmic thresholds, not on perceived inefficiencies or unpredictable market sentiments.\n\n#### Automated Short Orders\nAn **Automated Short Order** involves the placement of trades to sell securities that are not currently owned by the seller, but borrowed, with the intention to repurchase shares at a lower price. This trading strategy hinges on the anticipation of a price decline, which is facilitated by the SMA outfits designed to analyze specific OHLC patterns and market indicators that facilitate impending drops in stock prices. Automated Short Orders, or Precision Short Orders, are executed by high-frequency trading programs that capitalize on rapid, real-time market movements. These programs are finely calibrated to detect arbitrage opportunities and are functionally deployed by wealth conglomerates possessing substantial capital. This allows them to effectively manipulate market trends and maximize profits. The initiation of Automated Short Orders are critically dependent on systems interpreting market data, more specifically the SMA outfits, ensuring that trades are placed at the precise moment optimal conditions are detected, thereby enhancing profitability and market influence.\n\n#### Singular Point Hard Stop Order\nA **Singular Point Hard Stop Order** is a predetermined price level at which a trading position must be closed automatically. The Singular Point Hard Stop Order component is integral to the operation of precision Buying Algorithms and Automated Short Orders. By enforcing the execution of trades with rigorously calculated precision, Singular Point Hard Stop Orders operate to control high volume equity pivots in price action. This action automatically liquidates positions on a singular penny or \"point\" breach of a Precision Buying Algorithm to facilitate a swift execution of sell orders that maximize on price declines. Singular Point Hard Stop Orders are only operable due to the combination of liquidity in public equity markets and access to darkpool trading. This level of precision enables advanced trading divisions to execute and liquidate orders at the precise moment a singular point of penny breach occurs on a Precision Buying Algorithm or Automated Short Order, optimizing trade execution down to the millisecond.\n\n#### Dark Pools\n**Dark Pools** are institutional private trading routes that allow institutional trading divisions to access liquidity in order to trade large blocks of securities. Dark Pools or \"Dark Assault Routes\" preserves trading exposure to the public markets to minimize market impact for large transactions. This specific anonymity provided by Dark Pools allow for extreme discretion  for aggressive wealth firms to capitalize on and execute Precision Buying Algorithms, Automated Short Orders, and Singular Point Hard Stop Orders using the SMA outfits. The reduced impact of visible volume in the public markets ensure that significant trades can be executed precisely at singular point or penny entries or breaches without often without immediate impact. Dark Pools inherently obscure specific trading activity; breaches of precision Singular Point Hard Stop Orders are followed by large volume candles as substantial trading decisions have already been executed beyond the typical market view. Detailed examples will follow in subsequent sections, providing explicit demonstrations of market activities and these specific trading mechanisms.\n\n#### Institutional Hour Session\nThe **Institutional Hour Session** is the standard trading hours when major stock exchanges are active, typically between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). During these hours, trading volumes are higher, and the market operates on robust liquidity directly operating by the activities of large financial institutions. Moreover, the closing of the Institutional Hour Session often sets the stage for the Extended Hour Trading Session, where trading continues under different market conditions, typically marked by lower liquidity and higher volatility.\n\n#### Signal Generation\n**Signal Generation** in trading is the process by which advanced trading systems identify opportunities to buy or sell assets based on specific criteria or patterns derived from market data, more specifically the SMA outfits. This form of signal generation leverages quantitative models that integrates SMA data to fine-tune the timing and accuracy of trades. By focusing on SMA outfits, the signal generation process ensures that all trading actions are precisely aligned with organization, thereby maximizing the efficiency and profitability of trades. This exclusive reliance on SMA-based signal generation highlights its critical role in shaping the financial institution, ensuring that each trading decisions are backed by robust and predictive analytical science.\n\n\n## Data and Analysis\n\nThis section details the SMA outfits and associated parameters, covering the wide spectrum of timeframes and leading equities that are essential in the algorithmic precision that collaboratively drive public equity markets.\n\n### SMA Outfits Raw Data\n| Sma Configuration (base fx) | Description|\n| 10/50/200 | S&P\n| 20/100/250 | NAS\n| 30/60/90/300/600/900 | DJI\n| 33/66/99/333/666/999 | AN\n| 11/44/88/111/444/888 | AN\n| 22/55/77/222/555/777 | AN\n| 19/37/73/143/279/548 | Waring's Problem\n| 16/32/64/128/256/512 | Base 2/NVDA\n| 27/53/105/210/420/840 (420) | TSLA\n| 23/46/91/183/365/730 (365) | Time\n| 23/46/92/183/366/732 (366) | Time\n| 18/36/72/144/288/576 (144(0) | Time\n| 25/51/101/202/404/808 (404) | Resource missing\n| 29/57/114/227/455/911 (45) | U.S. president seat\n| (23/46/92/184/368/736 (46) | U.S. president seat\n| 28/56/112/224/448/896 (56) | U.S. speaker of the house seat\n| 28/57/114/228/456/911 (911) | World Trade Center homage\n| 16/31/63/125/250/500 (2000) | Russia's president seat year 2000\n\n\n### SMA Outfit Timeframes\nThe SMA calculations are performed over the following timeframes to enable precision complexity during periods of high or low volume and volatility. The specific timeframes include:\n\n- **Ultra Short-Term**: `1T` (tick), `1S` (second) during extreme high-volume volatility\n- **Sub-Minute**: `5s`, `15s`, `30s`\n- **Minute to Hour**: `1m`, `2m`, `3m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `20m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`\n- **Longer Periods**: `1D` (daily), `1W` (weekly), `1M` (monthly), `1Q` (quarterly)\n\n#### Monitoring Market Sessions\n\n- **Institutional vs. Extended Hours**: Arbitrage detection systems are meticulously designed to monitor and react to transitions between the SMA Outfit detection to operate on either the institutional trading hour and extended trading hour session. These periods often exhibit different liquidity and volatility characteristics, which impact arbitrage models. The systems are configured to dynamically adjust their strategies based on real-time market data to capitalize on unique conditions presented during either session. This adaptability ensures optimal execution of SMA strategies, maximizing efficiency and profitability for aggressive firms during transitioning market conditions.\n\n## Associated Parameters and Leading Equities\n\nThis section lists the leading equities and their respective tickers, which are critical components of the SMA-based trading strategies. These equities are monitored with abject precision to ensure optimal execution of arbitrage opportunities within the U.S. equity markets.\n\n## List of Key Tickers and Associated Leading Equities\n\nThis table lists (and is not limited to) the ticker symbols first, followed by the names of the corresponding leading equities, which are crucial for advanced arbitrage.\n\n| Ticker | Equity Description |\n\n| SPX    | S&P 500 Index      |\n| SPY    | S&P 500 ETF        |\n| IXIC   | NASDAQ Composite Index |\n| QQQ    | NASDAQ 100 ETF     |\n| DJI    | Dow Jones Industrial Average |\n| DIA    | Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF |\n| UPRO   | UltraPro S&P500    |\n| TQQQ   | UltraPro QQQ       |\n| SQQQ   | UltraPro Short QQQ |\n| WEBS   | Direxion Daily Dow Jones Internet Bear 3X Shares |\n| UDOW   | UltraPro Dow30     |\n| SDOW   | UltraShort Dow30   |\n| VIX    | CBOE Volatility Index |\n| VXX    | iPath B S&P 500 VXX BATS |\n| SVIX   | Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF |\n| UVXY   | Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF |\n| SVXY   | Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF |\n| SOXS   | Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares |\n| SOXL   | Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares |\n| UWM    | Ultra Russell2000  |\n| IWM    | Russell 2000 ETF   |\n| AAPL   | Apple Inc.         |\n| MSFT   | Microsoft Corp.    |\n| AMZN   | Amazon.com Inc.    |\n| GOOG   | Alphabet Inc.      |\n| NVDA   | NVIDIA Corp.       |\n| META   | Meta Platforms Inc.|\n| TSLA   | Tesla Inc.         |\n| AMD    | Advanced Micro Devices Inc. |\n| NFLX   | Netflix Inc.       |\n| INTC   | Intel Corp.        |\n| COIN   | Coinbase Global Inc. |\n| QCOM   | Qualcomm Inc.      |\n| PYPL   | PayPal Holdings Inc. |\n| UPST   | Upstart Holdings Inc. |\n| RBLX   | Roblox Corp.       |\n| AI     | C3.ai Inc.         |\n| ARM    | Arm Holdings       |\n| BRK-B  | Berkshire Hathaway Inc. |\n| GM     | General Motors Co. |\n| JPM    | JPMorgan Chase & Co. |\n| V      | Visa Inc.          |\n| UNH    | UnitedHealth Group Inc. |\n| ENPH   | Enphase Energy Inc. |\n| BTCUSD | Bitcoin USD        |\n| ETHUSD | Ethereum USD       |\n| BITO   | Bitcoin ETF        |\n| HSI    | Hang Seng Index    |\n| DAX    | German Stock Index |\n| BABA   | Alibaba Group Holding Ltd |\n| TSM    | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

The entire framework of U.S. equity markets operates specifically on the precision of these arbitrage detections and the outlined parameters. Any market activity outside of this defined scope is fundamentally based on guessing or unoptimized approaches, not supported by the actual framework of the public equity markets.\n\nA \"ticker\" or \"ticker symbol\" is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes on stock exchanges. Each ticker symbol represents a specific stock, ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), or other financial instrument and is used by traders and investors to uniquely identify and trade that security. For example, the ticker symbol \"SPY\" represents the S&P 500 ETF, which tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, and \"MSFT\" stands for Microsoft Corporation. Tickers are essential for executing trades on electronic financial markets and are used globally to streamline and standardize the process of buying and selling shares.\n\nThese datasets are stored in highly structured formats to facilitate complex statistical analysis, supporting both time-series analyses and real-time manufactured events.\n\nThey are typically normalized to ensure accuracy and reliability in statistical modeling and machine learning applications used in predictive analytics and algorithmic trading strategies. Aggressive trading operations are implemented with extremely calculated budgets.\n\nThese selections involve multiple simultaneous operations, as wealth entities leverage specific SMA configurations to exploit market efficiencies using singular selections on a singular SMA outfit, singular timeframe, and leading instruments (equities, ETFs, Bonds, Treasuries, indices). It's important to clarify that these operations optimize market efficiencies, NOT market \"inefficiencies\", a concept often misinterpreted through traditional definitions of arbitrage.\n\nThe precision of these SMA Outfits, operating in real time, forge capital flows across the U.S's financial vehicles, including the DXY dollar, volatility indices, individual equities, bonds/treasuries, leading ETFs, and major indices like the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, along with their tangential ProShare ETFs. This systematized framework is the foundation of U.S. public equity markets which rely on precision and effectiveness of SMA outfits in exploiting equity movements for profit, both in upward and downward movements at a multitude of frequencies.\n\nThe real-time, threaded, sharing of the analysis is proving to be pivotal in demanding transparency of the public equity markets. By openly sharing the operations of Simple Moving Average (SMA) configurations across 44,000 real-time instances, this body of work provides not just snapshots but a continuous, live-streamed narrative detailing how precision moves in the stock market can be mapped and predicted. This extensive evidence serves as direct proof of consistent, measurable mechanics of specific SMA setups operating the entire automated financial landscape.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Real Time Operations\n\nThis section contains detailed Twitter threads that illustrate various instances of \"Precision Buy Algorithms\" executed in real-time.

This is   \n\nALL RIGHT, I'm halfway through my ~~first~~ third coffee after sporting a little hangover, so here we go..... - Edit (some typos exist due to different trains of thought merged into a bit of a mess and one can forget to edit some words which once connected to the train)\n\n***TLDR*** \\- The need of ethically sourced rare earths from allied nations is paramount. There are environmental issues (leachate from tailings dams, erosion and radioactivity to name a couple) at rare earth mines such as the Bayan Obo mine in China, Mountain Pass in California and Mount Weld in W.A but of these issues are of different scales. EU and USA have regulatory bodies investigating supply chains which will be meet U.N guidelines whilst also provide them with autonomy. The means of achieving such independence include sourcing materials through recycling to produce rare earth elements to some effectiveness which does lessen dependence of certain producers and decreases waste simply through re-use such as ***NEO*** tsx, ***NMT*** asx and ***LIT*** asx. Some companies are trying to eliminate the need of rare earths altogether (Honda and Jaguar for example). The question is are non-ree-ev cars better? The general consensus is no. If recycling doesn't meet production quota's is - *environmentally friendly REE mining*. Sure, the plant will still need diesel for years (even the plant will be EV operated eventually) but it is way more environmentally friendly than it used to be. The companies which still rely on them if they still require rare earths - there is sorting equipment such as TOMRA (***VML***) and Steinert (***NTU***) which eliminate the need of tailings dams and deplete the radioactive run off risk. \n\n***Ok this is going to be ranty as fuck*** but - [u/BuiltDifferant](https://www.reddit.com/u/BuiltDifferant/) asked me a good question yesterday about this specifically within the yesterday\u2019s daily (my answer being ***VML*** and they knew about it already), so no worries mate, I'll put my useless framed piece of paper that says \"Bachelor of Environmental Science\" - with a geography and geology double major (and yes surely there are plenty here who will be way more qualified in this field of almost 80 k members because I'm just have a bachelor degree - and some may nit-pick and have even better suggestions, which is fair enough (this is what makes democracy good) - so I admit I am **FAR FROM AN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD**), but anyway, I may as well use my toilet paper degree with what limited memory and remaining cognitive ability I have for once for you *special people* and see what I can use this boundless resource at our fingertips which more often than not utilise for *frivolous & time wasting purposes* to see what I can find for you good folks. I'm just doing this in one day....\n\nWe kind of get what *'environmentally friendly'* means - not posing threat of environmental degradation. We get what *sustainable development* means - the ability to prosper whilst not wrecking the future generation\u2019s ability to. Mostly these are loaded words because often there are companies whose 'talk' is more glorified than their 'walk' - the media we are aware are ran by people and are businesses themselves so the system 'money talks', so there have been plenty that have gotten away with the issues they were the point source of (discounting Rio with the sacred site they exploded and some others). So, one must look at the environmental risks rare earth mining poses.\n\nANYWAY, before than - lets touch on the types of deposits - the USGS have summarised the types well - (a) carbonatites, (b) peralkaline igneous systems, (c) magmatic magnetite-hematite bodies, (d) iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, (e) xenotime-monazite accumulations in mafic gneiss, (f) ion-absorption clay deposits, and (g) monazite-xenotime bearing placer deposits.

A study has been done about the *Willingness to pay (WTP)* in order to gauge the public mindset if they care about the issues such as pollution, erosion, radioactivity, groundwater pollution, salinity etc in order to pay through higher prices to a) clean up previous cases of pollution and b) create a system with new infrastructure to decrease the likelihood of this happening in the future. \n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214790X20302951](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214790X20302951)\n\nIt's perhaps a bit of both but things are changing our fault and the CCP's. However, the CCP has created a super group where they have formed 2 large umbrella companies to create better regulations in the REE mining sector so hopefully they will create better standards (and stronger pricing powers as the articles headline suggests). \n\n[https://www.mining.com/web/china-to-form-two-rare-earth-giants-to-strengthen-pricing-power/](https://www.mining.com/web/china-to-form-two-rare-earth-giants-to-strengthen-pricing-power/)\n\nThe fact that China is the source of most rare earths has been a bit of a bargaining tool - we need to be on our best behaviour or else... We have had some geopolitical turmoil recently as well which I do not wish to go too much into - I mean what could that submarine in the South China/ West Philippine Sea hit? I have an idea - anyway, it\u2019s obvious that China has developed a monopoly of this highly sought-after product, so I will let this flow chart detailing their risks for three main future based sectors from the site below: [https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/42852](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/42852)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vdor31b8ss71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=90944b7e9d48574a0b4525c5774cac0f42ab4061\n\nSo basically Europe is well aware of their situation.....\n\nSince China (and Myanmar) are the source of these vital products, and they cause environmental issues there, but China can use them as a bargaining tool, it brings up the issue of NIMBY's (AKA Greenland with U)- the *not in my backyard* brigade. Who would want to have pollution and radioactive waste in their environment? I get it. But, to what end are they willing to possess the fruits such as technology sourced from others labour and environmental degradation in distant lands so the environmental effects barely impact them? We also need to secure our supply chain as well. There are changes in Europe and North America surround these issues where A) they source the REE materials independently B) they refine their own REE from the source material independently C) they do this through *environmentally friendly* practices *(basically way more environmentally friendly than has been the previous standard).*\n\nThere are ethical phones as well [https://www.fairphone.com/en/](https://www.fairphone.com/en/) \\- so I am unaware of how 'good' they are - I'm running around with an Apple iPhone 13 pro and I have ear buds - I basically use Apple because I am lazy AF when it comes to adapting to other phone tech. Maybe in the near future I'll make the switch.\n\nLets talk ***Europe*** \\- there are currently no active REE mines within the European continent. However, here's a journal article about REE in Europe if they do manage to get cracking, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136815300755](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136815300755)\n\nIf they do get cracking, the EU has the ERMA (European Raw Materials Alliance) and EIT (*European Institute of Innovation and Technology*) Raw Materials as regulators to ensure that whatever product is mined or part of the supply chain within Europe, green principles are a must? They are really anal about this, which is good.... SO, there are ***10 principles*** within the ***UN Global Compact*** \\- which the EU follows:\n\nHuman Rights\n\n[Principle 1](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-1): Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and\n\n[Principle 2](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-2): make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.\n\nLabour\n\n[Principle 3](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-3): Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;\n\n[Principle 4](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-4): the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;\n\n[Principle 5](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-5): the effective abolition of child labour; and\n\n[Principle 6](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-6): the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nEnvironment\n\n[Principle 7](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-7): Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;\n\n[Principle 8](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-8): undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and\n\n[Principle 9](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-9): encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nAnti-Corruption\n\n[Principle 10](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-10): Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\n\n[https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n\nSo in the future, if you are speculating that a penny stock may break out into Europe, you definitely want to be placing your dollarydoos in a company which meets these principles as a minimum (also the right thing to do as well imho gtlah)......\n\nAlso, ***Russia*** has reserves of 12 million tonnes of REE, and they are priming themselves to be ready for producing up to 7,000 tonnes annually by 2024 [https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-rareearths-idUSL8N2F73F4](https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-rareearths-idUSL8N2F73F4) \\- but will it be *environmentally friendly?

There are companies out there which are doing this on the asx able to extract and repurpose REE's such as Neo Materials TSX NEO [https://www.neomaterials.com/neo-performance-materials-joins-the-u-n-global-compact-and-commits-to-implementing-its-10-principles-to-promote-sustainability/](https://www.neomaterials.com/neo-performance-materials-joins-the-u-n-global-compact-and-commits-to-implementing-its-10-principles-to-promote-sustainability/). Neometals *NMT and* Lithium Australia *Lit* \\- battery recycling is simply battery materials, not Ree's which are in the permanent magnet motors, but if they obtain the whole car which is being recycled and not just the battery, they may both become a point source for recycling other products within used EV's and smart phones as well (if budget allows). Who knows what the future holds for both companies?\n\nOK SO FINALLY - \"environmentally friendly mining\" in Europe and North America.  \n For ***Greenland*** (not so environmentally friendly) you may wish to look at Eclipse Metals EPM asx - they have a cryolite/ rare earth deposit which is apparently free of Uranium - the Ivittuut deposit is simply different to Greenland Minerals Kvanefjeld deposit. Unlike GGG, EPM are in the Greenland government's good graces at the time of typing. If you look at the aerial image below, its definitely not 'environmentally friendly' - simply put, the previous mining company which finished back in the 80's did this. [https://www.eclipsemetals.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021.07.07-Greenland-Government-Approves-Ivittuut-Fieldwork-Programme.pdf](https://www.eclipsemetals.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021.07.07-Greenland-Government-Approves-Ivittuut-Fieldwork-Programme.pdf)\n\nWho knows what equipment they'll utilise in mining - obviously if its the standard equipment, it won't be environmentally friendly. It's all speculation at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23hp1iji8ss71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd0febb6368f37d3fbfe338b8cfbb64d2320d47\n\nEPM's Ivittuut is a brown field project...... Sure and they had a pretty good run over the last few months regarding their share price. I'm unsure about capex and opex - admittedly these terms are pretty new. (I am not holding btw). They obtained the lease for an old mine - so obviously we are dealing with different times. It's like the Greenland government think EPM can improve the area by mining it more.... Environmental related costs will be large when they are finished with production (but drilling may prove the deposit is worth it). At least there is no Uranium. The former pit is now dam on the left-hand side of the image. They apparently have tailings from the previous owner which have been proven to be economic in value so if they have customers lined up, they could be onto some revenue soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rkjmnml8ss71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=72ded1109e79ea6875fd0096c19cb055826a854b\n\nGreenland Minerals Kvanefjeld deposit sits roughly 550 m above sea level, 8 km from a major town of Narsaq. It is a greenfield project. on currently undeveloped land where the only environmental risk I guess increased mercury concentrations from melting glaciers. Who knows what risks the mine could pose to the town of 1,400 people? (2.5 %; of Greenland's population) \n\n[https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/earth-sciences/mercury-found-in-greenlands-glacial-meltwaters/](https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/earth-sciences/mercury-found-in-greenlands-glacial-meltwaters/)\n\nThere are other companies in exploration mode within Greenland listed on the ASX such as ***CNJ*** (Au, Cu, Ni, Co, Pd, Zn, Pb, Ag), ***Ibg*** (Zn, Pb), ***PGM*** (Au, Pd) and ***Igo*** (Cu). Greenland is obviously benefited by being centrally located. Since the ice is melting there will be more deposits exposed - it will be bare rock due to the ice sheet/ glacial erosion which will make things easier for geo's but this benefits of melting ice for exploration geo's doesn't have any issues for the rest of the global population whatsoever...... Unsure of other countries which have mining companies listed on their stock exchanges that are active at Greenland atm but that is all I am aware of.\n\n***North America*** \\-\n\nPresidents Trump and Biden may have been ***very different leaders***\\*,\\* but their rare earth policy aligned to a degree - where President Cofvefe Trump's term produced an executive order in October last year to commence investigation in the rare earth supply chain. President 'that fella from down under' Biden's infrastructure deal met a speed bump recently but the senate approved the temporary raise of the debt ceiling, so, crisis averted? These supply chain investigations will be completed by November 12 where companies will make submissions to the US Department of Commerce by the above time [https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/us-department-of-commerce-solicits-6403479/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/us-department-of-commerce-solicits-6403479/)\n\n[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=21472ae3-82e1-4536-950d-3e33fb7b3aa1](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=21472ae3-82e1-4536-950d-3e33fb7b3aa1)\n\nSo does this mean a President Biden led US will follow the same if not similar protocols the EU adheres to in the UN Global Compact? Will they follow the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change?\n\n***End users:*** This is a dynamic situation between Taiwan and China could either be forcing companies to jump to safer shores like North America/ Europe or its just me being pessimistic.

Tesla is an obvious other company worth listing and there are plenty others. Mns will have their plant operational in NY within the decade hopefully.\n\n**Production/ Explorers/ Recyclers:** Until recently, there weren't any rare earth mining operations in North America - this all changed when ***MP Materials (MP)*** (is it worth noting that Chinese company Shenghe Resources is a major shareholder? They are basically everywhere - *Ree* and *GGG* as well as plenty others) restarted operations at the Mountain Pass mine in 2017. Now you have ***Energy Fuels (UUUU)*** who have recently entered the ring to refine rare earths out of their uranium mine as well as target other rare earth mining companies within North America which would prefer their product to stay within the safe confines of their continent taking out shipping risks and potential international disputes.

But simple proximity to a Tesla factory isn't a sure thing. But sure, it could prove to be an advantage anyway. Environmentally friendly, we shall wait and see when they are up and running.

It really has the makings of a long-term play. The above policies and situational analysis mentioned leaves me to believe that VML is best placed to benefit in the rare earth production realm on a global scale.

Here, since no lakes seem to be interconnected (unsure of hydrogeological flow in this area \u2013 but it poses little risk of leaching if they do install a tailings dam). Also worth noting, theoretically a tailings dam won\u2019t even be installed there due to a Tomra sorter if/ when they are up and running at this site. It is also worth noting that the Kipawa community does have some members who are anti mining \u2013 which is fair enough. Hopefully Nechalacho will have no environmental issues (they should be okay) so this should provide a decent model for the local community to see the gains from an ethical mining facility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ncfwan39ss71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=948f656495cdb7a2d8eebcec904154120b426f4f\n\nFrom the looks of this - VML doesn't look that environmentally friendly either -at the top right of the image, the bunding wall within that rectangular area looks to be the start of artificial basin for a tailings dam. The sorting equipment negates the need of a tailings dam thus keeping the footprint of the mine down, which eliminates leaching risk. Also the low footprint limits the risk erosion.\n\n[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-mining-project/](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-mining-project/)\n\nIt could simply be a waste rock area which it seems there is some already dumped there. In any case, is there really any *environmentally friendly rare earth mining* on the planet? EV machinery will make it so. Point of the matter is that they are working toward lowering their environmental footprint with the SRC processing facility and VML's facility will be next door - so SRC is obviously another potential offtake target. They have had discussions with manufacturing companies in U.S and the E.U about their product but Geoff has been good and has kept who with and what was discussed quiet - and there has not been any paid advertisement disguised as media from him or VML. I believe that VML definitely meets all ten of the principles in the UN Global Compact. Low long-term risk is what I am happy with in the current economic climate.

Check out MHUB  First Mover Advantage:\u00a0MineHub is the first company to commercialize an end-to-end digital supply chain solution for the mining and metals industry. The Company has completed a number of successful projects, including the first ever blockchain-based iron ore trade (see press release dated June 29, 2020 at\u00a0www.minehub.com).   Industry Partners:\u00a0MineHub has been working with some of the largest sector participants in the world, including Wheaton Precious Metals, ING Bank, BHP, Vale, Kimura Capital, China Baowu and IBM to develop the commercial version of its platform, which was launched earlier this year and is onboarding both large corporate and SME users across the globe.   Development Growth Streams:\u00a0New applications will be available over the coming months to assist the industry with carbon emissions tracking, trade finance and product quality reconciliation (concentrate assay exchanges).   Expertise:\u00a0MineHub management, board and advisory board possess decades of resource market and technology industry experience, including founding roles for multiple commodity-based blockchain companies   Globally Established: MineHub is already present in key locations, with established teams in strategic markets such as Japan, Singapore and China, where more than 50% of metal commodity flows end up or are processed.   Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO at MineHub, said: \"We are very pleased to have completed our over-subscribed $10 million financing and listing on the TSX-V, especially at a time when industries are really starting to understand the transformational power of shared digital infrastructure and transparency in high value supply chains. Transparent governance is a fundamental requirement for adoption of decentralised platforms like MineHub.\"  Vince Sorace, Co-Founder and Chairman at MineHub, said: \"Our TSX-V listing represents an important milestone for MineHub. With a strong balance sheet, industry experts, and ample opportunities for growth, we have a solid foundation to execute our strategy to further build and grow MineHub into the preeminent enterprise platform for commodity supply chains. This industry is ripe for technological advancements and we have proven change is possible with a powerful suite of tools to aid in this digital transformation, from real time data to trade finance and ESG attributes such as carbon emissions tracking.\"   MineHub becomes the first publicly-traded pure play on an end-to-end digital supply chain solution for the mining and metals industry.\u00a0MineHub is an open, enterprise-grade platform for digital trade, bringing transparency, resilience and responsibility to mining and metals supply chains. The platform connects the many parties involved in physical commodity transactions in a digitally integrated workflow, operating on the basis of shared information secured by a global enterprise blockchain network. This is much more efficient, secure and transparent than the current paper-based and manual processes that are causing major cost and compliance drags in these supply chains.

He is selling \"$10B worth of shares\" was news already. It's not news anymore.  It's also concerning how little some of y'all get how this works. I'll clarify. Musk is an insider at Tesla. He made the decision to sell these shares months ago. There are rules in place to stop market timing and they work like this: if Mr. CEO wants to sell shares (for whatever reasons... taxes, doubt, etc) he enters his trades months in advance. He can only sell once a quarter.  When the trade actually goes through, it is \"VWAP'd\". (Volume Weighted Average Price) Split up, because unless we're talking penny stocks, walking up and entering a trade for 5 million shares is going cause a price change. There just isn't enough instantaneous volume on the market to absorb that volume without a major price change, especially not for $1,200 per share Tesla.  In Musk's case, this is a multi-day VWAP, since there are literally SO MANY shares being sold. His broker is selling 100 share bunches ALL DAY and giving him the average price at the end of the day when it's all added up.  So this isn't me being a Tesla bear, but the lack of price collapse is not a sign of anything. It's the system doing what it's literally designed to. The price only dropped because OTHER sells drove it down on the news.

Here\u2019s my analysis on chipotle:    1.\t\u20602600 stores currently with a plan to reach 6000 stores with growing AUV from 2 million to 3.5 million long term by 2030. Almost all of the stores are in the United States with a few in Canada and even less in the UK so international expansion is still wide open for them. On their latest call, Niccol said that they are still testing the European market but signs are looking good for further expansion into the EU (mostly the UK and France for now).  2.\t\u2060Piper Sandler came out with a teen survey that said Chipotle was one of the restaurants they would choose the most, alongside Chick Fil A and Starbucks. The majority of Chipotles customers are under 34 and an even greater amount under 24. Their customers are expected to provide a greater lifetime value than other competitors with aging clientele. Young customers also prefer to pay for healthier, quality food versus overly processed foods.  3.\t\u2060The switch to digital as well as the addition of drive thrus boosts profit margin. Mobile ordering also helps stay connected with the younger customers along with data collection  to know the customer better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dip a toe into dark or ghost kitchens to move into areas where the financials of spending a 1-2 million dollars for a physical store don\u2019t make sense. These dark or ghost kitchens will have huge margins. 4.\t\u2060Great management, great financials, no long term debt. Enough cash to pay off any remaining debt. FCF increasing. The physical stores typically pay for themselves around a year and a half. It isn\u2019t a franchise so they keep 100% of the 25% profit margin.  5.\t\u2060Moat. Very few people realize or believe their moat because after all they just make burritos. But McDonald\u2019s just does burgers, Starbucks just makes coffee and dominoes just does pizza. IMO and Morningstar\u2019s opinion they have a wide moat. I believe their moat comes in the form of brand value and pricing power. The chipotle brand is synonymous with quality, similar to Apple. When Apple has a product with a glitch or defect it makes the news where as other brands don\u2019t. When chipotle came out with the original Queso dip people didn\u2019t like it and it made the news. Mis steps for this company are few and far between with the quality of their food (here your probably thinking the food illness problem from a few years ago, I\u2019ll address that below). Because of the brand value, Inflation and price hikes don\u2019t affect the customer loyalty as customers are willing to pay for quality. When they added Carne Asada, they increased the price .25 cents and saw \u201cno degradation\u201d in demand \u201cat all.\u201d Price increases may affect McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and other competitors more as their entire business model is to provide as much cheap food for the lowest cost. Well that cost is crawling up with inflation so the value isn\u2019t as great as it once was. Along with the brand value created pricing power. Pricing power in rising prices without affecting demand but also in the price of the store locations. Strip mall and mall owners often give chipotle a deal on the lease or rent because they know chipotle will drive foot traffic which may help other businesses. A new store typically pays for itself in about a year and a half.  6.   The food poisoning issue seems to be behind them. Almost all large food chains have had their share of food poisoning issues (KFC, Jack in the box, Burger King and more) yet they\u2019re all still around. Chipotles was three years ago, which led to a new CEO with Brian Niccol who came from Taco Bell and is used to running large food chains and has since cleaned up the food illness problems. Long story short, I listened to a podcast with Steve Ells (the founder) where he explained that they disinfect every single item on the menu before it even gets to the store. For example, they boil avocados for 4 seconds to completely kill germs on the outside AND the inside which doesn\u2019t affect flavor (which is new from what they were doing).  7. They basically invented the fast casual form of restaurant. When a new company tries their business model it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe chipotle of\u2026\u201d   Risks that I see (I may miss something but I don\u2019t trust DD without any risks listed)  1.\t\u2060Like Apple\u2019s insistent demand of quality, any food illness problems will hurt their brand value more than others. Food illness is a risk for any restaurant but I believe the news is much more likely to make a big deal about chipotle\u2019s problems than a Taco Bell or other company because they commit themselves to quality. This will in turn crush chipotles brand loyalty. 2.\t\u2060The drive thrus are capital intensive and they haven\u2019t been proven to be successful yet. 3.\t\u2060The demand for superior ingredients are subject to hired risk from the suppliers prices. 4.\t\u2060Competition from other quick service restaurants. 5. The valuation is a lot higher than other restaurants but it\u2019s finding support around the 1790s range.    Obviously I\u2019m very bullish in chipotle. I think it\u2019s a great long term investment. I think a lot of people over look them because the business model is so simple but then again, so is Coca Cola\u2019s. It\u2019s also a lot sexier to tech.   When it comes to Portillo\u2019s, I love it. I grew up on it and in fact I\u2019m having it tonight. I got it shipped to my house since I don\u2019t live by one anymore. My main concern is whether they can teach people what Italian Beef sandwiches are since most people have never heard of it. I just think the upside of chipotle is greater than Portillo\u2019s.](/r/stocks/comments/qr3pha/your_favorite_restaurant_stocks/hk556ax/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 00:49:56 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[The CEO should start tweeting shit like \"Feelin' cute, might sell the company to Saudi Arabia later\" to get more news attention.](/r/stocks/comments/qqyg1b/rivian_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/hk61q4n/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 05:07:11 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Apart form Tsla, what other exclusively-battery-car companies have IPOed?

Introduction to Aptiv PLC and Its Role in the Automotive Technology Landscape\n\nAptiv PLC is a large global automotive technology supplier headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The company designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of advanced vehicle components, integrated systems, and software solutions for major automakers worldwide.\n\nAptiv's key product areas include advanced safety technologies, autonomous driving systems, connected services, data management platforms, and vehicle electrification solutions. The company also has a significant presence in the aerospace and defense industries through its subsidiary, Wind River Systems, which provides software and services for mission-critical intelligent systems.\n\nAptiv's customer base includes most of the world's leading automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and many others. In addition, through its Wind River subsidiary, Aptiv serves as a contractor for various government and military agencies, providing software and services for aerospace, defense, and other critical infrastructure applications.\n\nThe company has a strong global presence, with a workforce of over 200,000 employees across 120+ manufacturing facilities and 12 major technical centers in 44 countries. Notably, Aptiv operates a significant data center in China, which has raised concerns among some cybersecurity experts and policymakers about the potential for data privacy and national security risks.\n\nIn terms of market size, Aptiv is a significant player in the automotive technology industry. In 2020, the company reported net sales of $13.1 billion, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aptiv's market capitalization as of April 2023 stands at approximately $28 billion, reflecting its substantial market value and industry position. The company's Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, which includes many of the data-driven technologies discussed in this document, accounted for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2020, demonstrating the significant scale of these systems in modern vehicles.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, autonomous, and data-driven, Aptiv's role in the automotive technology landscape continues to grow. The company's vast array of sensors, software platforms, and data management systems are becoming increasingly central to the operation of modern vehicles, raising important questions about data privacy, security, and potential misuse that will be explored further in this document.\n\nHowever, Aptiv's involvement in government contracting and its operation of a data center in China add additional layers of complexity and concern to these issues. The company's access to sensitive government and military data through its Wind River subsidiary, as well as the potential for data hosted in its Chinese data center to be accessed by foreign actors, raise serious questions about the company's data practices and the adequacy of its security measures.\n\nThese concerns are particularly acute given the increasing importance of connected vehicle data for national security, critical infrastructure, and personal privacy. As policymakers and regulators grapple with the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of automotive technology, it is essential that the roles and practices of key industry players like Aptiv be subject to rigorous scrutiny and oversight.\n\nIn the following sections, this document will delve into the specific risks and concerns associated with Aptiv's data collection practices, as well as the broader implications of connected vehicle technology for personal privacy, public safety, and national security. By examining these issues in depth, we hope to contribute to a more informed and robust public dialogue about the future of automotive technology and the steps needed to ensure that its benefits are realized while its risks are effectively mitigated.\n\n1. Sensors, Systems, and Data Collection in Aptiv-Equipped Vehicles\n\nModern vehicles, especially those equipped with Aptiv's advanced technologies, contain a wide array of sensors, systems, and components that collect vast amounts of data and control various vehicle functions. These components are essential for enabling features like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, connected services, and vehicle safety enhancements. However, they also raise important privacy, security, and safety concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data they collect and the control they have over the vehicle.\n\nSome of the key sensors, systems, and data collection components found in Aptiv-equipped vehicles include:\n\n* GPS (Global Positioning System): GPS sensors track the precise location of the vehicle at all times, generating a detailed record of the vehicle's movements and routes.\n* Cameras: Modern vehicles often include multiple cameras, both inside and outside the cabin. These cameras can capture video and images of the vehicle's surroundings, as well as the occupants inside the vehicle.\n* Radar and Lidar: Radar and lidar sensors use radio waves and laser light, respectively, to detect objects and obstacles around the vehicle. They generate detailed 3D maps of the vehicle's environment and are critical for ADAS and autonomous driving features.\n* Accelerometers and Gyroscopes: These sensors measure the vehicle's acceleration, braking, and turning movements. They provide data on the vehicle's motion and driving dynamics.\n* Biometric Sensors: Some advanced vehicle systems include biometric sensors that can monitor the driver's attention level, eye movements, heart rate, and other physiological parameters.\n* Microphones: Many vehicles include microphones for voice commands, hands-free calling, and in-cabin noise cancellation. These microphones can potentially pick up conversations inside the vehicle.\n* Infotainment Systems / Human-Machine Interface (HMI): Modern vehicles feature sophisticated infotainment systems, also known as HMIs, which serve as the central interface for the driver and passengers to interact with the vehicle's features and functions. These systems often include touchscreens, voice controls, and connectivity features like smartphone integration. HMIs can collect and store data on user preferences, usage patterns, and even personal information synced from connected devices.\n* Speaker Systems: Vehicle speaker systems, especially those with advanced features like active noise cancellation or personalized audio zones, can include embedded microphones that monitor the acoustic environment inside the cabin. While primarily used for enhancing audio experience, these microphones could potentially be used for eavesdropping if compromised.\n* Actuators: Vehicles contain numerous actuators that control various functions such as braking, steering, throttle control, and suspension adjustments. In modern vehicles, especially those with ADAS or autonomous driving features, these actuators are often controlled by electronic control units (ECUs) that receive input from various sensors and systems. While essential for vehicle control and safety, the ability to remotely manipulate actuators through compromised ECUs or control systems could pose serious safety risks.\n* Telematics Systems: Telematics systems transmit vehicle data wirelessly to remote servers for analysis and processing. This can include diagnostic information, usage patterns, and even real-time sensor data from the systems mentioned above.\n\nIt is important to note that as a tier-one supplier deeply integrated into the vehicle's systems, Aptiv has access to the data generated by these sensors and components without the explicit knowledge or consent of the end customers (i.e., the vehicle owners or occupants). This raises significant concerns about data privacy, ownership, and control. Customers may be unaware of the extent of data being collected by their vehicles and transmitted to Aptiv, and they may have limited insight into how that data is being used or shared.\n\nThe data generated by these sensors and systems is often highly personal and sensitive in nature. Location data, biometric information, in-cabin audio and video, and personal data from HMIs all raise significant privacy concerns. The ability to control vehicle actuators and manipulate vehicle behavior through compromised systems poses severe safety and security risks.\n\nFurthermore, the transmission and storage of this data, as well as the wireless interfaces used to communicate with vehicle systems, introduce additional vulnerabilities. Malicious actors could potentially intercept sensitive data, take control of vehicle functions, or manipulate vehicle behavior remotely.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe next section will delve into some of the specific risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle sensor data, control systems, and the largely opaque data practices of automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv.\n\n1. Risks and Potential Misuse Cases Associated with Vehicle Data, Control Systems, and Supplier Access\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle data, control systems, and supplier access can be broadly categorized into three main areas: remote viewing, remote communication, and remote sensing. Each of these areas presents unique challenges and threats to individual privacy, security, and autonomy.\n\n1. Remote Viewing\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of modern vehicle technology is the ability for connected systems to enable remote viewing of a vehicle's interior and surroundings. This capability is made possible by the numerous cameras and imaging sensors embedded in today's vehicles, which can capture detailed video and images both inside and outside the cabin.\n\nSome of the key risks and potential misuse cases associated with remote viewing include\n\n* Invasion of Privacy: In-cabin cameras can capture intimate details of a vehicle's occupants, including their facial expressions, behaviors, and personal belongings. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this video feed could enable severe privacy violations and potentially even be used for blackmail or extortion.\n* Stalking and Harassment: Real-time access to a vehicle's interior cameras could be exploited by stalkers, abusers, or other malicious actors to monitor and harass their targets. This is particularly concerning in cases of domestic violence or obsessive behavior, where perpetrators could use remote viewing to track and intimidate their victims.\n* Corporate Espionage: In-cabin cameras could also be misused for corporate espionage, particularly in cases where sensitive business discussions or negotiations take place inside a vehicle. Competitors could potentially gain access to confidential information by remotely monitoring a targeted vehicle's interior.\n* Voyeurism and Exploitation: The ability to remotely view a vehicle's interior could also enable disturbing cases of voyeurism and sexual exploitation. Bad actors could potentially hack into vehicle camera systems to spy on occupants in compromising situations or even record and distribute intimate footage without consent.\n* Surveillance and Monitoring: Remote viewing capabilities could be exploited by governments, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies to conduct invasive surveillance and monitoring of targeted individuals or groups. This could have chilling effects on freedom of speech, association, and political dissent.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to vehicle camera systems. This should include strong encryption, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for clear regulations and guidelines around the use of in-cabin cameras and remote viewing capabilities. This should include strict limits on when and how these features can be used, mandatory disclosure to vehicle occupants when they are being recorded, and robust protections against misuse by law enforcement or government agencies.\n\nConsumers should also be empowered with meaningful control over the cameras and imaging sensors in their vehicles, including the ability to physically disable or cover these components when not in use.\n\nUltimately, while remote viewing capabilities may offer some benefits in terms of safety and convenience, the risks to individual privacy and security are significant. As such, the development and deployment of these technologies must be approached with the utmost caution and transparency, and with the rights and interests of consumers as the top priority.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any of these points or if you have any other suggestions for this section on remote viewing risks. I'm happy to refine the content to ensure it comprehensively addresses the key concerns.\n\n1. Remote Communication\n\nAnother significant risk associated with connected vehicle systems is the ability for remote communication and interaction with a vehicle's internal components and control systems. This includes the capability to update firmware, modify software settings, and even directly control physical actuators like brakes, throttle, and steering.\n\nThese remote communication channels present a wide array of potential attack vectors and misuse cases:\n\n* Malicious Firmware Updates: By compromising the firmware update process, a hacker could potentially install malicious code onto a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs). This could allow them to manipulate vehicle behavior, disable safety features, or even take complete control of the vehicle remotely. Such attacks could be carried out at scale, targeting entire fleets of vehicles simultaneously.\n* Disabling Safety Systems: Hackers could exploit remote communication vulnerabilities to disable critical safety systems like airbags, anti-lock brakes, or electronic stability control. This could be done for malicious purposes, such as causing accidents or facilitating other crimes, or as part of a larger terrorist attack or act of cyberwarfare.\n* Targeted Attacks and Assassinations: The ability to remotely control a vehicle's acceleration, braking, and steering could enable terrifyingly precise targeted attacks. Hackers could potentially cause a specific vehicle to crash, allowing for nearly untraceable assassinations or \"accidental\" deaths.\n* Ransomware and Extortion: By gaining remote control over a vehicle's systems, hackers could effectively hold the vehicle and its occupants hostage. They could demand a ransom payment in exchange for releasing control of the vehicle, or threaten to cause an accident if their demands are not met. This could be particularly effective against fleet vehicles or those belonging to high-value targets.\n* Bot Networks and Distributed Attacks: Compromised vehicles could be used as part of a larger botnet or distributed attack network. Hackers could harness the collective computing power and connectivity of many vehicles to conduct large-scale denial-of-service attacks, mine cryptocurrencies, or spread malware to other connected systems.\n* Theft and Hijacking: Hackers could exploit remote communication channels to unlock and start vehicles remotely, enabling sophisticated theft schemes. They could also potentially hijack vehicles in motion, taking control away from the driver and rerouting the vehicle to a desired location.\n* Privacy Breaches: By accessing a vehicle's communication systems, hackers could potentially intercept sensitive data transmissions, including personal information, location data, and even audio from in-cabin microphones. This could enable identity theft, stalking, or other privacy breaches.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with remote communication are not just theoretical. In a deeply concerning incident, it was revealed that private keys used to secure vehicle communication systems were leaked online. These keys, if obtained by malicious actors, could potentially grant unauthorized access to thousands of vehicles, enabling the kinds of attacks and misuse cases described above.\n\nThe leak of these private keys underscores the urgent need for more robust cybersecurity measures and more transparent disclosure of potential vulnerabilities by automotive technology suppliers. It also raises serious questions about the industry's ability to safeguard the integrity of vehicle systems and protect consumers from cyber threats.\n\nThe risks posed by remote communication vulnerabilities, combined with the demonstrated reality of critical security failures like the leaked private keys, present a grave threat to public safety and national security. As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, the potential impact of these attacks will only continue to grow.\n\nRegulators, industry stakeholders, and the cybersecurity community must come together to address these risks head-on, through a combination of stronger regulations, more robust technical safeguards, and greater transparency and accountability from automotive technology suppliers.\n\nThe leaked private keys incident should serve as a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry, and a catalyst for more aggressive action to secure vehicle systems against cyber threats. This should include a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the leak, as well as a comprehensive review of cybersecurity practices across the industry.\n\nUltimately, the risks associated with remote communication in connected vehicles are complex, multifaceted, and rapidly evolving. Addressing these risks will require sustained collaboration, innovation, and vigilance from all stakeholders. The stakes could not be higher, and the time for action is now.\n\n1. Remote Sensing\n\nIn addition to the risks associated with remote viewing and communication, connected vehicles also present significant concerns related to remote sensing capabilities. Modern vehicles are equipped with a wide array of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors, which can gather detailed information about the vehicle's surroundings and occupants.\n\nFrom a malicious actor's perspective, these remote sensing capabilities could be exploited for a variety of nefarious purposes, posing serious threats to personal privacy, public safety, and even national security:\n\n* Surveillance and Tracking: By accessing a vehicle's external sensors, malicious actors could potentially track the movements of targeted individuals or groups with unprecedented precision. This could enable intrusive surveillance by governments, law enforcement, or private entities, undermining personal privacy and civil liberties.\n* Psychological Operations (PSYOPs): The data gathered by a vehicle's sensors could be used to build detailed psychological profiles of individuals based on their driving habits, frequented locations, and social interactions. This information could be exploited for targeted propaganda, manipulation, or blackmail, enabling sophisticated psychological operations at scale. Moreover, in a disturbing scenario, a malicious actor could potentially use a vehicle's sensors and control systems to actively manipulate the driving experience, causing intentional distress or even fear in targeted individuals. For example, by subtly altering the vehicle's handling, braking, or acceleration, an attacker could create a sense of unease or anxiety in the driver, making them more susceptible to manipulation or coercion. In more extreme cases, an attacker could potentially use a vehicle's systems to create overtly frightening or dangerous situations, such as causing sudden, unexpected braking or swerving, or even staging apparent near-misses or collisions. By inducing a state of heightened stress and fear, an attacker could potentially influence a targeted individual's behavior, decision-making, or even mental health over time. The use of connected vehicles as a tool for psychological manipulation represents a chilling evolution of traditional PSYOPs tactics, enabling a level of targeted, personalized, and persistent influence that has never before been possible. The implications of this for personal autonomy, mental well-being, and even political stability are deeply concerning.\n* Fingerprinting Nearby Devices: A vehicle's wireless communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, could be used to scan for and fingerprint nearby electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices.

Stephen Tedford [said](https://defensescoop.com/2023/04/03/navys-future-halo-hypersonic-missile-might-not-actually-be-hypersonic/) during a briefing at last year\u2019s Sea-Air-Space conference hosted by the Navy League.\n\nThe service is requesting $179 million in fiscal 2025 for research, development, test and evaluation funding for the project \u2014 much more than the $99 million that previous budget plans anticipated.\n\nThe Navy is also planning to spend $197 million in fiscal 2026, $177 million in 2027, $167 million in 2028 and $147 million in 2029 on RDT&E for the initiative.\n\nBy comparison, spending projections released last year anticipated $83 million in 2026, $85 million in 2027 and $86 million in 2028 for RDT&E of HALO. Funding projections for fiscal 2029 were not included in the budget justification documents released last year because they fell outside the five-year planning period covered by those books.\n\nIn order to counter evolving \u201cnear-peer\u201d threats, HALO has been \u201caccelerated\u201d to achieve early operational capability in fiscal 2029, according to the new justification documents. The Navy requested $96 million for the program in fiscal 2024. The increase proposed for 2025 would support a transition from a middle-tier acquisition program to a major capability acquisition effort at Milestone B.\n\n\u201cThis transition will allow for Early Operational Capability (EOC) in FY 2029,\u201d per the justification books.\n\nNaval Air Systems Command previously awarded two contracts\u00a0to Raytheon Missiles and Defense and Lockheed Martin in 2023, with a total value of $116 million, for initial development work on the HALO technology.\n\nAn engineering and manufacturing development contract is scheduled to be awarded in fiscal 2025, according to the justification documents. Subsystem critical design reviews, the process of acquiring long lead material, and qualification test events are also expected to begin.\n\nA Milestone C production decision is expected in fiscal 2027.\n\nThe new budget justification books include a line item that appears to indicate planned procurement funding for HALO beginning in fiscal 2027. Projected funding under that line item includes $59 million in 2027, $98 million in 2028 and $157 million in 2029.\n\n# Given article also posted here by Geldvos ~ MARCH 4th, 2024 ~ Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere\u2019s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle  [Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere\u2019s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle (csis.org)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hypersonic-hegemony-niobium-and-western-hemispheres-role-us-china-power-struggle)\n\n[ Photo: RHJ\\/Adobe Stock ](https://preview.redd.it/7efa76lpi2qc1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b360b4ff6173446617940019f72e2ae6057a941)\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn the evolving landscape of global defense, the arms race has metamorphosed from a contest of nuclear might to one of unparalleled speed. [Hypersonic weapons](https://www.csis.org/analysis/complex-air-defense-countering-hypersonic-missile-threat) (capable of exceeding [five times the speed of sound](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)), promise to revolutionize modern warfare.\n\nChina's strides in the hypersonic field are a manifestation of its broader strategic intentions and underscore its drive toward technological and military preeminence. This journey toward mastering hypersonic technology is not merely for show; it is about redefining the global balance of military power.\n\nA successful deployment of these weapons would enable China to redefine the term \u201cfirst-strike advantage.\u201d Such a capability is not merely about striking first; it is about striking in a manner that leaves the opponent minimal time or capacity to react, effectively nullifying their defensive postures. This introduces a dangerous paradigm wherein the traditional cushion of time provided by early warning systems is drastically reduced. For the United States, this might mean that even with the world's most advanced detection systems, the [window to act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45811/35) could be so minimal that it might be rendered ineffective. As the United States and China jostle for dominance in this arena, the strategic significance of an elemental material, niobium, emerges as a pivotal concern, and with it, China\u2019s rising dominance in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s mining sector.\n\n# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel\n\nVacuum-grade niobium\u2019s [role](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/) in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures [over 2,400 degrees Celsius,](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/) renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium\u2019s pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a [high strength-to-weight ratio](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/), which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like [SpaceX and Hermeus](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/) depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.\n\nFor decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic [Gemini and Apollo](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474) programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since [1959](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf). This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated [8,800 metric tons](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/) imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from [Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/). This heavy reliance on just two primary sources\u2014both neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere\u2014exposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China\u2019s dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.\n\nChina\u2019s Stake in Brazil\u2019s Mineral Monopoly\n\nBrazil dominated global niobium production in 2020, accounting for over [91 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316) of production. With reserves estimated at [842 million metric tons](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/), Brazil produces roughly [120,000 metric tons annually](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/). Brazil\u2019s high production comes from large mines such as [Arax\u00e1 and Catal\u00e3o](https://www.cradleresources.com.au/what-is-niobium/), with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Minera\u00e7\u00e3o (CBMM) controlling [75 percent of Brazil\u2019s output](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/).\n\nChina has recognized the potential of niobium for over a decade. In 2011, a consortium of [five Chinese companies](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/) acquired a 15 percent stake in CBMM. This engagement intensified in 2016 when China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. (now known only as CMOC) secured ownership of the [Chapad\u00e3o and Boa Vista mines](https://dialogochino.net/en/extractive-industries/25588-niobiums-silent-impact-in-brazil/), further strengthening China's position in the niobium market.\n\nThe importance of niobium was further highlighted in the Brazilian political arena in 2018. Then presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro emphasized niobium's role in Brazil's \u201c[economic independence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-china-niobium/hands-off-brazils-niobium-bolsonaro-sees-china-as-threat-to-utopian-vision-idUSKCN1MZ1JN/).\u201d Despite Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric focusing on safeguarding this critical commodity from foreign control and advocating for its national governance, Chinese influence in the Brazilian niobium sector continued to grow. By 2020, Chinese entities controlled approximately [26 percent of Brazil's niobium production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316). This control not only ensures China's preferential access and influence over pricing dynamics in the niobium supply chain, but also positions it advantageously in a global context.\n\nChina managed to maintain and even strengthen its position at the subnational level under Bolsonaro. CMOC for instance provided [$1.2 million](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/04/brazils-economic-ties-china-flourish-despite-political-shifts) in Covid-19 aid to the city of Catal\u00e3o, demonstrating China's strategic engagement beyond mere commercial interests.\n\nChina\u2019s influence over Brazil\u2019s niobium production conforms to a [pattern](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/) of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the [second most critical of 50 minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072), falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth.\n\n# Defense Implications\n\nChina's hypersonic resolve has been remarkable. By 2018, it had [conducted over 20 times](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf) as many tests as the United States. According to the Pentagon, the United States is [still lagging.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/04/18/pentagon-yes-we-are-still-lagging-behind-chinas-hypersonics/) This hypersonic prowess, combined with China's stranglehold on niobium, places the United States in a perilous position.\n\nThe strategic importance of niobium in next-generation defense systems cannot be overstated. As the U.S. military and its defense contractors increasingly rely on niobium-based superalloys to produce a wide range of equipment, from aircraft components to hypersonic missile systems, any disruption in the niobium supply chain could have significant repercussions.\n\nOverall, China's growing influence and control over critical mineral supply chains poses a distinct challenge. Under the Biden administration, the United States and the European Union placed export controls and restrictions on strategic and critical minerals to curb China\u2019s dominance in [artificial intelligence and semiconductors](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-to-make-of-chinas-latest-restrictions-on-critical-mineral-exports/). In retaliation, China imposed their own limitations on [gallium, germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-flexes-critical-metals-muscles-with-export-curbs-2023-07-10/), and [graphite](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/) throughout 2023. A recent analysis by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions#:~:text=China%20produces%2090%20percent%20of,90%20percent%20of%20global%20graphite.) highlighted that China controls 90 percent of global gallium supplies, 90 percent of graphite, and 60 percent of germanium, all critical to the production of chips and electric vehicle batteries. The critical mineral supply chain has arrived at the forefront of strategic competition between the West and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nChina\u2019s grip on the production, distribution, and pricing of niobium presents another layer of complexity: manipulating niobium\u2019s availability to other nations. For the United States, already grappling with the challenges of overdependence on external sources for critical minerals, such a disruption could translate into significant production delays. The consequences could be serious: slower production of critical defense equipment, increased costs due to the potential need for alternative materials, and a cascading effect on existing machinery's maintenance and upgrade cycles. In this highly complex environment where timely responses to emerging threats are vital, these delays could hinder the United States' ability to promptly deploy or develop necessary defense systems.\n\n# U.S. Countermeasures\n\nFacing such formidable challenges, the United States cannot afford to remain a passive observer. Safeguarding its strategic interests and maintaining its global position demands a comprehensive and multifaceted critical mineral strategy, particularly in securing niobium supplies.\n\n# Including Brazil in the MSP\n\nIncorporating Brazil into the 13-nation [Mineral Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) could significantly fortify the global niobium supply chain. The MSP represents a concerted multinational endeavor to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and bolster investments in critical mineral supply chains, an initiative that aligns well with the strategic interests of both Brazil and the broader international community. Brazil\u2019s inclusion would make it the first Latin American country to enter the partnership, signaling its regional leadership and increase in international stature. The integration of Brazil into this partnership is particularly strategic, considering its substantial niobium reserves, in addition to its other critical mineral deposits. This move would add a robust layer of security against potential supply disruptions.\n\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's administration, with its strong emphasis on ESG standards, is likely to find the MSP's principles congruent with its [policy priorities](https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/363907-will-lula-be-brazils-environmental-saviour/). The MSP\u2019s emphasis on elevating global standards in these areas could resonate with Lula\u2019s progressive agenda, potentially making Brazil\u2019s participation both beneficial and attractive.\n\nFurthermore, Brazil's inclusion in the MSP would facilitate its adherence to a framework that advocates for the diversification and stabilization of mineral supply chains. This alignment could be instrumental in mitigating China\u2019s dominant influence in the niobium market. By joining the MSP, Brazil would not only assert its role in the global mineral economy but also contribute to a more balanced and less vulnerable critical mineral supply landscape, including niobium.\n\n# Diversification of Niobium Sources\n\n# Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue. The [Elk Creek project](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states) in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act [calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/), and \u201cencourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.\u201d\n\n# However, to comprehensively mitigate the risks associated with niobium supply, the United States should extend its strategy beyond domestic projects. Engaging in international partnerships, especially with Canadian, African, and European nations that have niobium reserves, is crucial.\n\n# Canada\u2019s significant niobium reserves stands as an ideal partner to strengthen North American supply security. The geographical proximity of Canada to the United States offers logistical advantages, reducing transportation costs and environmental impact. Additionally, the strong political and economic ties between the United States and Canada could facilitate smoother bilateral agreements and joint ventures in niobium exploration and development.\n\n# Africa\u2019s rich mineral resources, and Europe\u2019s advanced mining technologies and regulatory frameworks, offer promising avenues for collaboration. These partnerships could lead to the exploration and development of new niobium sources, thus diversifying the global supply chain.\n\n# Stockpiling and Strategic Reserves\n\nThe practice of stockpiling and maintaining strategic reserves of strategic minerals serves as a crucial safeguard during times of geopolitical unrest or supply chain interruptions. Experts suggest that with its existing reserves of critical minerals, the United States may [face challenges in sustaining](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/) a protracted conflict with China. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS), designed to support the nation's needs for up to [four years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), is perceived by some as insufficient for the United States to execute its strategic military objectives effectively. Proactive measures to accumulate substantial reserves of niobium and other strategic minerals are imperative. While in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Congress appropriated [$218.5 million](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833) for total NDS acquisitions, it remains at an unsatisfactory level to support the nation\u2019s needs. Congress should place more effort in supporting the NDS in the future. Strategic stockpiling must be revitalized to Cold War-era levels so that the United States maintains its capability to meet both economic and defense production demands, even under challenging global scenarios.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn the grand chessboard of defense geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance. The intertwining of mineral control and technological advancements underscores the multifaceted nature of modern security threats. For the United States, addressing this dual challenge is not just about catching up in the hypersonic race or diversifying niobium sources, but about reimagining its strategic approach in a complex global landscape\u2014one where the Western Hemisphere takes center stage. Recognizing and mitigating these vulnerabilities will be crucial in ensuring U.S. national security in the face of strategic competition. The stakes are high, and the game is evolving; proactive measures today will dictate the balance of power tomorrow.\n\n# *****SEE NIOCORP/JIM SIM'S Responses given on Jan. 3rd, 2024 - to relevant questions asked Dec. 18th, 2023\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zjuiqd1m2qc1.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=c92f2b7da87be005652af946d932db28ade4f5dd\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ****SEE ALSO PREVIOUS LINK TO HYPERSONICS & LOCKHEED MARTIN!

However, beyond their sustainable benefits, owning a hybrid car can also unlock significant cost savings through **hybrid car insurance discounts**. As the automotive industry continues to innovate with [**Semiconductor Innovation**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-qualification-requirements.html) and [**Automotive Technology**](https://www.insurista.net/2023/12/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-guide.html), understanding the intricacies of these discounts can help hybrid owners maximize their savings while embracing a greener lifestyle.\n\n## Hybrid Car Insurance Discounts:\n\nInsurance companies recognize the inherent advantages of hybrid vehicles, such as improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and advanced safety features. As a result, many insurers offer [**hybrid car insurance discounts**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/maximize-hybrid-car-insurance-discounts.html) to incentivize drivers to make eco-friendly choices and mitigate potential risks associated with these vehicles.\n\nThe factors that influence insurance premiums for hybrid cars are multifaceted. Safety features, such as collision avoidance systems, anti-lock brakes, and advanced airbag technologies, play a crucial role in determining the level of discount offered. Insurers view these safety enhancements as risk-mitigating factors, potentially leading to lower claims and reduced repair costs in the event of an accident.\n\nFurthermore, driving habits are a significant consideration when calculating insurance rates for hybrid owners. Studies suggest that individuals who choose hybrid vehicles tend to exhibit more responsible driving behavior, covering fewer miles and being less likely to engage in risky practices on the road. This reduced risk profile can translate into substantial savings on insurance premiums.\n\nQuotes from industry experts underscore the importance of these factors:\n\n>\"Hybrid cars are often equipped with advanced safety technologies that can help prevent accidents or mitigate damage in the event of a collision,\" says Xavier Sabastian, an auto insurance expert. \"Insurers recognize this and may offer discounts to hybrid owners as a result.\" \\[Source: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/hybrid-car-insurance](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2525374199617559544/6609446269825725513#)\\]\n\nReal-world examples showcase the tangible benefits individuals have experienced by choosing specific hybrid models or leveraging available discounts. Emma, a Tesla Model 3 owner, enjoys an 8% discount on her $1,500 premium, saving around $120 annually. Similarly, John, who drives a Toyota Prius, receives a 6% discount on his yearly premium, reducing his costs by $90.\n\n## Most Expensive to Insure:\n\nWhile hybrid vehicles generally offer insurance savings, some models can be more expensive to insure than others. For instance, the Audi RS6 Avant Quattro can cost up to $3,922 annually to insure, making it one of the most expensive hybrid models in the US market.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the higher insurance costs associated with these models. The repair costs for specialized components and advanced technology found in high-end hybrids like the Audi RS6 Avant Quattro can be substantial, driving up insurance premiums. Additionally, the theft risk for these expensive vehicles is heightened, increasing insurance rates.\n\nInsights from industry experts shed light on this phenomenon:\n\n>\"The higher price tag and complex equipment of electric cars can result in increased repair or replacement costs, impacting insurance premiums,\" explains Tim Derham, CEO at Universal Casualty. \\[Source: [https://www.universalcasualty.com/blog/high-insurance-costs-for-electric-cars/](https://www.universalcasualty.com/blog/high-insurance-costs-for-electric-cars/)\\]\n\n## Least Expensive to Insure:\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some hybrid models are among the least expensive to insure in the US market. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV stands out as a cost-effective option, with annual premiums varying across different insurance companies.\n\nFactors contributing to lower insurance premiums for these models include their impressive safety ratings and affordability. Hybrids with high safety ratings are considered less risky to insure, leading to reduced premiums. Additionally, models like the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which are more affordable in terms of pricing and repair costs, can result in lower insurance rates due to the decreased financial risk for insurers.\n\n## Specific Makes and Models:\n\nWhen it comes to popular hybrid models, the Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion Hybrid, and Chevrolet Volt are among the most recognizable names in the market. These vehicles offer varying annual insurance rates depending on the insurer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l6h13i7p3pc1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3180a80a6398418fd0b67c885d2a99dfae1a0cc3\n\n* **Toyota Prius:** USAA offers insurance for the Prius at $1,201 per year.\n* **Ford Fusion Hybrid:** Liberty Mutual provides coverage for the Fusion Hybrid at $1,777 annually.\n* **Chevrolet Volt:** Nationwide insures the Volt at an average of $1,349 per year.\n\nQuotes from industry experts highlight the importance of considering a hybrid model's safety record and longevity in the market when seeking insurance discounts:\n\n>\"As hybrids become more popular, insurance companies are increasingly likely to offer discounts to hybrid drivers,\" says Xavier Sabastian. \"This trend is driven by the fact that hybrid drivers typically cover fewer miles and are considered safer on the road, leading insurers to consider passing on discounts to them in the future.\" \\[Source: [https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2023/01/16/637854.htm](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2023/01/16/637854.htm)\\]\n\n## Potential Risks and Considerations for Hybrid Vehicle Insurance\n\nWhile hybrid cars offer numerous benefits, including potential insurance discounts, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks and considerations associated with insuring these vehicles. By understanding these factors, hybrid owners can make well-informed decisions and mitigate any potential pitfalls.\n\n**1. Higher Maintenance Costs** One of the primary considerations for hybrid vehicle owners is the potentially higher maintenance costs compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Hybrid vehicles incorporate complex technology, including battery packs and electric motors, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Regular maintenance and specialized service requirements may also contribute to increased ownership costs over time. \\[Source: [https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrid-electric-vehicles/the-cost-of-maintaining-a-hybrid-car/](https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrid-electric-vehicles/the-cost-of-maintaining-a-hybrid-car/)\\]\n\n**2. Coverage Limitations** It's essential to carefully review your insurance policy and understand any coverage limitations or exclusions that may apply to hybrid vehicles. Some insurers may exclude or limit coverage for certain components, such as batteries or electric motors, which could result in unexpected out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim.\n\n**3. Availability of Qualified Repair Facilities** Finding qualified repair facilities equipped to handle hybrid vehicle repairs can be a challenge, particularly in certain regions. This can lead to longer repair times and potentially higher costs if vehicles need to be transported to specialized facilities.\n\n**4. Battery Replacement Costs** The battery pack is a crucial component of a hybrid vehicle, and its replacement can be a significant expense. As batteries age and degrade over time, owners may face substantial costs for replacement, which could impact the overall cost of ownership and potential insurance premiums.\n\n**5. Resale Value Considerations** While hybrid vehicles generally hold their value better than traditional gasoline-powered cars, their resale value can be impacted by factors such as battery condition and the availability of newer, more advanced models. This may influence insurance costs and should be considered when evaluating long-term ownership costs.\n\nTo mitigate these potential risks and considerations, it's essential for hybrid vehicle owners to:\n\n* Research and compare insurance policies from reputable providers, ensuring comprehensive coverage for hybrid-specific components and risks.\n* Maintain regular maintenance schedules and follow manufacturer recommendations for optimal performance and longevity.\n* Locate qualified repair facilities in their area and familiarize themselves with the repair process for hybrid vehicles.\n* Budget for potential battery replacement costs and factor them into the overall ownership expenses.\n* Stay informed about the evolving hybrid vehicle market and consider resale value implications when making purchase decisions.\n\n## Maximizing Savings:\n\nTo maximize insurance savings as a hybrid owner, exploring various practical tips can prove invaluable. One effective strategy is bundling policies, such as combining auto insurance with home or renters insurance. Insurers like State Farm and Allstate are known for offering competitive rates for bundled policies, allowing hybrid owners to capitalize on significant discounts.\n\nAdditionally, hybrid owners should actively seek out [**hybrid-specific discounts**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/tips-negotiating-hybrid-car-insurance-discounts.html) offered by insurers. These discounts can range from 5% to 10% and may increase based on responsible driving habits and continued ownership of a green vehicle. For example, Geico provides a 5% discount for hybrid owners, while Travelers and Farmers offer a 10% discount.\n\nMaintaining safe driving habits is also crucial for securing affordable insurance rates. Obeying speed limits, avoiding distractions, and maintaining a clean driving record can qualify hybrid owners for the lowest possible rates.\n\nReal-world examples illustrate the potential savings:\n\n* Emma, a Tesla Model 3 owner, enjoys an 8% discount on her $1,500 premium, saving around $120 annually.\n* John, a Toyota Prius driver, receives a 6% discount on his yearly premium, reducing his costs by $90.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nAs the automotive industry continues to evolve, embracing sustainable practices and [**Design Solutions**](https://www.insurista.net/2023/12/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-state-specific.html), hybrid vehicles offer a compelling combination of eco-friendliness and cost savings through insurance discounts. By understanding the factors influencing these discounts, such as safety features, driving habits, and vehicle models, hybrid owners can make informed decisions to maximize their savings while contributing to a greener future.\n\nInsurers recognize the benefits of hybrid vehicles and are increasingly incentivizing their adoption through attractive discounts. By exploring bundling options, leveraging hybrid-specific discounts, and maintaining responsible driving practices, hybrid owners can significantly reduce their insurance costs and enjoy the financial rewards of embracing a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nAs the demand for hybrid and electric vehicles continues to grow, consumers need to stay informed about the evolving insurance landscape and the potential savings available. By considering [**hybrid car insurance discounts**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/hybrid-car-insurance-myths-facts-discounts.html) as a part of their overall ownership strategy, drivers can not only contribute to a cleaner environment but also experience tangible financial benefits, making the transition to eco-friendly transportation a smart and rewarding choice.\n\n**Table: Most Expensive and Least Expensive Hybrid Models to Insure in the US**\n\nMost Expensive Hybrid Models - Average Annual Insurance Cost \n\nAudi RS6 Avant Quattro - $3,922\n\nPorsche Panamera - $3,855\n\nAcura NSX Type S - $3,626\n\nLeast Expensive Hybrid Models -  Average Annual Insurance Cost\n\nMitsubishi i-MiEV - Varies across insurers - \n\nToyota Prius - $1,201 (USAA)\n\nFord Fusion Hybrid - $1,777 (Liberty Mutual)\n\nChevrolet Volt - $1,349 (Nationwide)\n\nRead more in [my blog](https://www.insurista.net/2024/03/best-car-insurance-hybrid-electric-cars.html).", "Donation Guide crowd-sourcing request: CHILDREN'S TOYS and BABY STUFF Hello [r/declutter](https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/)!    I am working on a \"donation guide\" that will go in the \"useful links\"    section. I'd like to ask you to read what I have come up with and add    any other ideas or suggestions you may have. If you're from outside  of   the US, please let me know so I can highlight any ex-US options.\n\nI    will periodically post categories of the guide for review. If you  have   an urgent request, let me know and I will work on that topic  next.\n\nToday's topic is CHILDREN'S TOYS and BABY STUFF\n\nFYI, the default for any \"gently used item in good condition\" is always going to be **1) donate to your local thrift store** and **2) offer up on-line.**  My goal is to capture any less obvious donation (including recycling)  opportunities.\n\nAnd remember, trash is always an option!\n\n# Dislcaimer!  I did not have any children so this is a category I am not very familiar with so all you decluttering mamas (and papas and guardians), help me out!\n\np.s. I'm also working on a separate \"outdoor, sporting goods, & bikes\" category if you notice that glaring omission.  Children's books is covered in the \"books\" category, children's clothing and shoes is covered in the \"clothing\" category, and children's blankets and other \"textiles\" are covered in the \"linen, bedding, and towels\" category.  I will include links to those sections in the text when I publish.\n\n**CHILDREN'S TOYS**\n\nThis includes action figures & play sets, activity books, art supplies & kits, baby toys, bath toys, board games, boxed games, building blocks & sets, card games, collectible figures & play sets, coloring books, craft supplies & kits, developmental & educational toys, dice games, dominoes & other tile games, drawing supplies, electronic toys, fashion dolls, fidget games, Lego bricks & sets, math & counting games, miniatures, model kits, musical toys, outdoor toys, picture books, play sets, puzzles, remote-control toys, ride-on toys, robotics, roll-playing games, science & engineering games, strategy games, stuffed animals, video games & consoles, etc.\n\n**Selling:**\n\n**Children's consignment stores** often sell gently-used/like-new children's toys and books as well as clothing - call the store and ask.\n\n**Good Buy Gear** [https://goodbuygear.com/](https://goodbuygear.com/) is an online consignment store for open-box and gently used baby and kid gear.\n\n**Donation guidelines:**\n\nChildren's toys in GOOD CONDITION are generally acceptable for donation. But not all toys should be donated. It's a fact of life that \"well-loved\" toys will wear out eventually and most neglected toys don't improve with age.  Toys that are dirty, damaged, broken, incomplete, missing pieces/parts, outdated, scribbled on, chewed on, excessively drooled on, low-quality, toxic, or potentially dangerous should go in the trash, not in the donation bin.\n\nResist the temptation to burden someone else with your crummy toys. Take 1-800-Got-Junk's advice and \"make sure that you're donating for the right reasons - don't donate just because you want to get rid of something; donate because you want to help others.\" If you're not sure your donation is appropriate, call the store/organization and ask for their donation guidelines.\n\n**Make sure to check for any product recalls before you donate any items designed for babies or children!**\n\nIf you do decide to donate your unwanted toys, make sure they are clean/sanitized before you donate.\n\n**Thrift Store:** Anything in new or like new condition will probably sell the best.  Check out the store and see what they have for sale. If your items are in similar or better condition, then chances are good that they will end up on the shelves. When in doubt, call and ask the store what they will accept.\n\n**Offer up on-line**: Know your toys are going to a good home and put an actual face to your donation. This would be especially appropriate for used items in good but less-than-resalable condition. And you never know what crazy stuff other people want for projects.\n\n**Where to donate:**\n\nBe aware that increased sanitation concerns since the global pandemic may have impacted an organization's ability to accept previously owned children's toys for donation. It always makes sense to contact the organization directly for restrictions or limitations on what they can accept.\n\n**Children's Home Society of America** [https://www.chsamerica.org/](https://www.chsamerica.org/) has child and family resource centers across the US that provide a variety of services to orphaned and at-risk youth.\n\n**Child Welfare Information Gateway** [https://www.childwelfare.gov/resources/states-territories-tribes/](https://www.childwelfare.gov/resources/states-territories-tribes/) has a searchable database where you can search for foster care, adoption agencies, support groups, and other youth organizations.\n\nMany towns/cities, places of worship, park districts, public libraries, etc hold annual **community garage sales, tag sales, yard sales, etc** where children's items are likely in high demand.\n\n**Daycare/childcare providers, nursery schools, preschools, Head Start programs, Montessori educators, public and private school teachers, after school programs, etc** may accept gently used toys, books, and games for their school/center/classroom.  Contact the office or a teacher/provider directly and ask if they are interested in what you have to donate.\n\nIf your local provider or business has a **waiting room**, they may have toys available for children to play with while they wait. Ask the receptionist/staff if they are interested in what you have to donate.\n\n**Domestic violence/sexual assault shelters, homeless shelters, and other supportive/transitional housing** may accept gently used donations for their clients with children. Do a Google search for \"women's shelter + your zip code\" or \"homeless shelter + your zip code\" or \"transitional housing + your zip code\" to find contact information for any facilities in your area.\n\n**Little Free Library** [https://littlefreelibrary.org/map/](https://littlefreelibrary.org/map/) some libraries may accept gently used toys but make sure to contact the homeowner or business before adding any non-book donations.\n\n**Retirement homes, nursing homes, and adult day care centers** are always looking for puzzles, board games, stuffed animals, coloring books & crayons, arts & craft supplies, etc for their residents and clients.\n\nYour **place of worship** may accept gently used toys, books, and games for religious education or childcare services.  They may know of a specific child or family in need. Do a Google search for \"religion of choice + family services + your zip code.\"\n\nYour local **police & fire departments** may accept gently used toys and stuffed animals for first responders to help comfort children facing traumatic and scary situations.  Call the station and ask if they are interested in what you have to donate.\n\n**Public Libraries** sometimes have toy areas for their patrons or their patron's children.\n\nThere are a variety of social services that help support children who are homeless, part of a refugee population, victims of disaster, fire, domestic abuse/violence, have a incarcerated parent or a parent in an addiction recovery program, etc. Your **municipal/county Social Services department** should be able to refer you to a local organization that helps at-risk children and youth in your local area. They may know of a specific child or family in need.\n\n**Toy Library, Toy Closet, Toy Exchange** will generally accept gently used toys, puzzles, and games for their collection. Do a Google search for \"toy library + your zip code\" and see if there is are toy rental or lending opportunities in your community.\n\n**Veterinarian clinics, animal hospitals, animal shelters,** w**ildlife rehabilitation organizations, etc** may accept clean, durable toys that can be disinfected and stuffed animals that can be laundered to use as toys or companions. Ask the receptionist/staff if they are interested in what you have to donate.\n\n**Other donation options:**\n\n**Samaritan's Purse's Operation Christmas Child** [https://www.samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/) accepts shoeboxes filled with small toys, hygiene, items, and school supplies that they send to children affected by war, poverty, natural disaster, famine, and disease.\n\n**Second Chance Toys** [https://www.secondchancetoys.org/](https://www.secondchancetoys.org/) accepts plastic toys in like-new condition during bi-annual toy drives or at participating drop-off locations across the US.\n\n**Stuffed Animals For Emergencies (SAFE)** [https://stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org/](https://stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org/) accepts clean, gently used stuffed animals, blankets, books, children's clothes, and baby items for drop-off at chapter locations or during volunteer toy drives around the US.

You can schedule a pick up online.\n\n**Recycling**\n\nRecycling options are limited for plastic toys because even if the plastic components are properly identified and separated, recycling options are limited. Metal toys are generally considered scrap metal and electronic toys can be treated as electronics waste.\n\nLittle Tykes toys seem to last forever - sometimes all they need is a good cleaning, a new coat of paint, and maybe some replacement hardware (available online) to restore them to good condition.  But if you have something that is cracked or has \"soft\" spots, it might be time to consider trashing.  Little Tykes are made with recyclable plastics (HDPE #2, LDPE #4, and PP #5) so contact your municipal/county recycling program, or whatever company manages your solid waste disposal, and ask them if they accept large plastic toys and how they should be prepared for recycling (metal parts removed).\n\nMajor retailer including **Hasbro** [https://hasbrotoyrecycling.hasbro.com/en-us/toy-recycling](https://hasbrotoyrecycling.hasbro.com/en-us/toy-recycling), **Mattel** [https://shop.mattel.com/pages/playback](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/playback), **Lego** [https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/replay?locale=en-us](https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/replay?locale=en-us) have toy take back programs.\n\nMany other toy manufacturers have partnered with **TerraCycle** [https://www.terracycle.com](https://www.terracycle.com/) to provide recycling programs for their toys. Search the site for \"toys\" and see if there are any free recycling programs available in your region. Otherwise, you can purchase a Zero Waste Box for action figures, baby gear, stuffed animals, and toys.\n\n**BABY STUFF**\n\nThis includes baby baths & bath toys, bassinets, breastfeeding pillows, booster seats, blankets, breast pumps, bouncy seats, books, car seats, carriers/slings, cribs & crib mattresses, diapers, diaper bags, exersaucers, feeding equipment (bottles, bibs, tableware, etc), jumpers, high chairs, pack-and-plays, portable swings, strollers, toys, wipes, etc.\n\nMost of the **social service organizations** that accept children's' toys will also accept baby-specific items for donation in good condition.\n\nMany communities have a **baby bank** that accepts donations of gently used baby clothing, furniture, equipment, and toys and then make them available free of charge to any parent who needs help with the costs of having a baby. Do a Google search for \"baby bank + your zip code\" and see if there are any in your area.\n\n**Problematic donations:**\n\n**Breast Pumps -** the FDA considers breast pumps to be single-user medical devices and does not recommend donating or sharing (open or closed-system) breast pumps therefore most women's shelters, homeless shelters, and lactation programs can no longer accept them.  But people do offer up pumps to neighborhood buy nothing groups or on Facebook mom groups.\n\n**Medela** [https://medela.us/breastfeeding/medela-recycles](https://medela.us/breastfeeding/medela-recycles) accepts their breast pump motors and power cords for recycling by mail.\n\n**TerraCycle** [https://shop.terracycle.com/en-US/products/baby-gear-zero-waste-box](https://shop.terracycle.com/en-US/products/baby-gear-zero-waste-box) has a Zero Waste Box for non-electronic items associated with babies and baby care.\n\n**Car Seats -** expiration dates, product recalls, accident history, etc. Some charities will accept used car seats in good condition, many will not.

It does not constitute professional or legal advice. Individual insurance rates and discounts vary by provider, vehicle, location, and driver factors. For the most accurate information on insurance rates and eligibility for discounts, contact your specific insurance provider directly.*\n\n## Introduction\n\nHybrid cars have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their **environmental benefits** and potential **hybrid car insurance discounts**. These vehicles combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor and battery, allowing them to achieve better fuel economy and produce fewer emissions than conventional cars.\n\nThis article will provide an overview of the key advantages of hybrid vehicles, including:\n\n* Reduced environmental impact\n* **Improved fuel efficiency**\n* **Contribution to a low-carbon economy**\n* **Insurance discounts**\u00a0are offered specifically for hybrid cars\n\nWe'll also look at how hybrid cars compare to fully electric and conventional gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of environmental friendliness, costs, and insurance rates. Understanding the benefits can help drivers make informed decisions when purchasing and insuring a new car.\n\n## Environmental Benefits of Hybrid Cars\n\nHybrid cars offer several important **environmental benefits** compared to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. By combining an internal combustion engine with a battery-powered electric motor, hybrids can achieve better **fuel efficiency** and produce fewer **emissions** under real-world **driving conditions**.\n\nThis section will provide an overview of key advantages of hybrids, including:\n\n* **Reduced carbon emissions** \\- Hybrids typically produce 20-40% less carbon emissions than comparable conventional vehicles because they can drive on electric power alone for limited distances and don't rely solely on gasoline \\[1\\]. This lowers their carbon footprint.\n* **Improved fuel efficiency** \\- The electric motor in a hybrid supplements the power from the gasoline engine, allowing better fuel economy. Hybrids get an average of 50-60 mpg compared to around 30 mpg for similar-sized gasoline-only models \\[2\\]. Their high fuel efficiency reduces fossil fuel usage.\n* **Contribution to a sustainable environment** \\- Widespread adoption of hybrids powered by renewable energy helps move society away from dependence on fossil fuels. This supports a **low-carbon economy** and a more sustainable future \\[3\\].\n\nWe'll also look at some of the **life cycle impacts** and discuss how hybrid technology supports **sustainability initiatives**.\n\n## Insurance Discounts for Hybrid Cars\n\nIn addition to environmental benefits, hybrid cars may qualify drivers for specialized **hybrid car insurance discounts**. Many insurance providers offer lower rates and premiums to hybrid owners as a way to recognize eco-friendly **hybrid vehicle incentives**.\n\nThis section provides an overview of some of the common types of **green car discounts** available, including:\n\n* **Green car discount** \\- Some insurers provide a discount of up to 10% for any make and model hybrid car due to their environmental benefits \\[4\\].\n* **Safety feature discounts** \\- Hybrids often come equipped with advanced safety technologies like automatic braking and lane departure warning. These features can earn additional discounts of up to 30% \\[5\\].\n* **Low mileage discounts** \\- Since hybrids use less gas, drivers may accumulate fewer miles. Low mileage can warrant up to a 25% reduction in premiums \\[6\\].\n* **Good driver discounts** \\- Statistics show hybrid drivers get into fewer accidents than the average motorist. This qualifies them for good driver discounts \\[7\\].\n\nThe potential **insurance incentives** can help you make the best decision when choosing a hybrid vehicle. We'll outline the typical discount amounts, insurance company offerings, eligibility requirements, and how hybrid owners can maximize their chances of securing the best rates through **hybrid-specific policies**.\n\nThere are also some common myths and facts to be aware of when exploring hybrid car insurance discounts, such as misconceptions about eligibility requirements. [Hybrid Car Insurance: Common Myths and Facts about Discounts](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/hybrid-car-insurance-myths-facts-discounts.html)\n\nThe availability of customized **hybrid insurance discounts** presents yet another reason drivers may opt for these more fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicle options\n\n## Comparison with Conventional Cars\n\nHow do hybrid vehicles stack up against conventional gasoline-powered models in areas like environmental friendliness, costs, and insurance rates? This section provides an overview of key **comparisons** between hybrids and traditional cars.\n\nWe will look at differences in:\n\n### Environmental Impact\n\n* Hybrids produce **20-60% fewer lifetime emissions** than conventional cars \\[8\\]. However, electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions \\[9\\].\n* Both hybrid and electric vehicles help reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

They have a warranty for 50 000 or 100 000 miles and when that is done they expect you to BUY a new car.  If you really want to ride you car for a long time, get to know your vehicle and the engine oil you use and examine the oil over the months you drive.  I use synthetic oil and they recommend changing every 15 000 km (9,0000 miles) for my 1998 Toyota Camry 2.2 liter.  The car with oil filter takes only 3.6 liters of oil, a little under a gallon.  There is NO WAY I am going to follow that interval!  I change the oil every 5000 km (3000 miles).  Luckily my car does not burn a drop of oil but modern cars often do burn a little oil and manufacturers call this \"normal\".  Since most people rarely check their oil and examine the condition and color, determine an oil chhange interval that works for you, based on your vehicle and your driving habits and where you drive.  Don't buy the hype of very long oil change intervals.  Changing the oil is cheap and keeps your engine in peak condition.  New engines are very expensive to buy and install.\n\n# Overfilling the oil in an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) can have several negative consequences:\n\n**Foaming:** When the oil level is too high, the crankshaft can whip the excess oil into a frothy foam.

The building blocks of plastics, such as polymers, are processed and combined with additives to form the specific type of plastic needed for various applications. These can be shaped into products like bottles, bags, containers, and countless other items.\n\n# Depending on how you calculate recycling, only 5-15% of plastic is recycled properly on the earth.  If petrochemical companies want to continue to ruin the planet, the least they can do is to make sure the plastic they make can be 100% recycled and recycled properly without the massive  guilt trip placed on the public.  You petrochemical companies made the plastic, you recycle it proper or don't make it at all!   Recycling PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) can be quite challenging due to their chemical structure and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bonds, which are extremely difficult to break and are called forever chemicals. These substances are pervasive in the environment and have been detected in various forms, including in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we consume. PFAS and certain plastic components have been detected in the womb and breast milk, perhaps we should be renamed the Naked Plastic Ape.      I suggest the banning of PFAS immediately in the plastic making industry and leaving the plastic straw alone, if it can be properly recycled, Mr Trudeau.

This shortage has sent a significant shockwave through the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) sector, creating a dire need for agile supply chain solutions to counteract the impact. Toma Matutyte, CEO of Locatory.com, a leading aircraft parts locator in the aviation aftermarket, shares insights on the reasons behind the titanium shortage, the consequences it has brought, and the potential solutions that MROs must adopt to navigate this challenging landscape.\n\n## The role of Ukraine in titanium production\n\nTo understand the titanium shortage, it is essential to recognize Ukraine\u2019s historical significance as one of the largest producers of titanium in the world. Ukraine\u2019s rich titanium resources, particularly the deposits located in the Zaporizhia region, have played a crucial role in global supply. However, the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the war in Ukraine have disrupted this supply chain.\n\nWhile Ukraine itself does not manufacture metallic titanium or its finished products, the country exports titanium concentrates, which are subsequently processed and utilized in various nations. Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian state-owned United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC Titanium) managed to export a substantial 82.2 thousand tons of titanium-containing ores between July 2022 and April 2023. Reports from KyivPost and other investigations carried out by Ukrainian and Western media outlined that a notable portion of these shipments ultimately reached Russia.\n\nThe world\u2019s most significant titanium producer, the Russian VSMPO-Avisma Corporation, has historically depended on Ukrainian raw materials and continues to do so. Investigators have raised alarms, as VSMPO-Avisma\u2019s products are widely used in global aerospace production.\n\nRussia was a significant supplier of titanium to both Boeing and Airbus before the war. Boeing even had established a joint venture with VSMPO-AVISMA, a part of Rostec, a Russian government-owned industrial and defense conglomerate. As recently as November 2021, just three months before the war began, Boeing and VSMPO-AVISMA had extended and expanded their collaboration, with approximately one-third of Boeing\u2019s titanium coming from Russia.\n\nIn Airbus\u2019s case, their reliance on Russian titanium supplies was even more substantial. While they didn\u2019t have a joint venture like Boeing, it\u2019s estimated that they sourced about half of their required titanium from Russia. However, the war has brought about a significant change.\n\n# To illustrate the gravity of the titanium shortage issue, according to KPMG\u2019s Aerospace & Defence Outlook 2023, titanium shortages have been identified as one of the top supply chain concerns in the aerospace industry. The Oliver Wyman Global Fleet and MRO Market Forecast Update 2022 report highlighted that the demand for titanium in aviation is expected to grow steadily, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nMeanwhile, AviationPros reported that US aviation supply chain challenges, including parts shortages and rising costs, are partly attributed to the titanium shortage. Ukraine\u2019s titanium production has been severely impacted by the Russian invasion leading to a decline in exports and a tightening of global titanium supply. This disruption has had far-reaching consequences, as titanium is a vital material in aerospace manufacturing, known for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and high-temperature stability. As CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) is becoming more widely used in the production of airframe and engine components, global demand for titanium used in aerospace manufacturing is also rising as the metal is perfectly compatible with CFRP when it comes to coefficient of thermal expansion and even corrosiveness.\n\nIn addition to airframe components, titanium alloys find application in modern aircraft engines, including turbofan motors, which power the majority of the world\u2019s most popular commercial aircraft. Titanium plays a critical role in the production of key engine components, such as the fan, compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s titanium production has decreased significantly, contributing to a global titanium production decrease of approximately 12% over the last five years, as per the Oliver Wyman Global Fleet and MRO Market Forecast Update 2022. The shortage has led to a sharp increase in titanium prices. AviationPros puts down that rising costs are one of the factors pressuring the aviation supply chain, with titanium being a major contributor to these cost escalations.\n\nNumerous indicators suggest that the biggest aerospace manufacturers, like Boeing, Airbus or Embraer were making earnest efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian suppliers ever since the invasion began and even before the majority of Western sanctions on Russian exports were applied. Nonetheless, as challenging as it was already, additional issues were piling up ever since. While Russia stands as the world\u2019s third-largest titanium producer, lagging behind China and Japan in terms of material output, it had held the position of the primary supplier of aerospace-grade titanium, contributing to half of the world\u2019s aerospace titanium prior to 2022.\n\nVarious strategies are being considered to address this issue. One possible solution is to procure titanium from China, which overtook Russia as the world\u2019s foremost titanium producer many years ago. However, this approach still presents challenges, as China\u2019s titanium production is steadily increasing, and it would essentially shift the West\u2019s titanium dependency to another nation.\n\nThe shortage has resulted in delays and disruptions in the production of critical aerospace components, impacting aircraft manufacturing and maintenance schedules. \u2018MROs are experiencing resource crunches, with access to sufficient titanium materials becoming increasingly difficult. This directly affects their ability to repair and maintain aircraft.\n\n## Agile supply chain management as solutions for MROs\n\nIn the face of these challenges, MROs must adopt agile supply chain strategies to mitigate the impact of titanium shortages\u2019 \u2013 explains Matutyt\u0117. Acknowledging the current state of the MRO industry, outlines the following strategies to offset supply chain risk in MRO.\n\n1. **Diversify Suppliers**: Reduce dependence on a single source of afterparts by diversifying suppliers and exploring alternative sources. Collaboration with global suppliers is vital to ensure a stable supply of titanium parts.\n2. **Strategic Stockpiling**: Maintain strategic stockpiles of critical titanium compounded materials and parts, to buffer against supply disruptions. This ensures a consistent flow of materials even during shortages.\n3. **Advanced Forecasting**: Utilize advanced forecasting tools and data analytics to predict and plan for material shortages, enabling proactive responses rather than reactive measures.\n4. **Technology Adoption**: Embrace innovative technologies, such as 3D printing and advanced composite materials, as potential substitutes for titanium in certain applications, reducing dependency on traditional materials.\n5. **Collaborative Partnerships**: Foster collaborative partnerships within the aerospace and aviation industry to collectively address supply chain challenges and share best practices.\n\nThe titanium shortage, exacerbated by disruptions in Ukraine\u2019s production, has presented a formidable challenge to the MRO sector and the broader aerospace and aviation industries. As highlighted by key statistics, the consequences of this shortage are far-reaching, impacting production, costs, and resource availability. Locatory.com as part of the Avia Solutions Group family, the world\u2019s largest ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance) provider will continue to deliver solutions in the competitive aviation aftermarket landscape. To navigate this turbulent landscape, MROs must be agile in their supply chain management. Diversifying suppliers, stockpiling critical materials, and embracing innovative technologies are essential steps toward ensuring resilience in the face of ongoing titanium shortages. Collaborative efforts within the industry will play a pivotal role in finding sustainable solutions to this supply chain crisis. By doing so, the aviation industry can continue to soar, even in the face of titanium scarcity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n# Nov. 9th , 2023~ World\u2019s Biggest Aircraft Makes Its Ground Debut:\n\nLighter Than Air's massive zeppelin-like airship is now undergoing outdoor operations testing in Mountain View, California. \n\n [World\u2019s Biggest Aircraft Makes Its Ground Debut | Extremetech](https://www.extremetech.com/aerospace/worlds-biggest-aircraft-makes-its-ground-debut) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymf3lbvfaezb1.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee4d29982d5c501832c9abfc85583c7cd33636d\n\nNASA alumnus Alan Weston and Google co-founder Sergey Brin have been working on something big. The duo have spent the last decade designing, testing, and building support for Pathfinder 1, an experimental hybrid airship longer than three Boeing 737s strung together. Now, the fruit of their labor is finally emerging from its supersized hangar to make its ground debut in Mountain View, California, where the airship will undergo outdoor flight operations testing before attempting its first real flight.\u00a0\n\nAt 124.5 meters (408 feet) long, Pathfinder 1 is already the largest aircraft the world has seen since 1930. It looks a lot like a blimp or a zeppelin, both of which traditionally leverage lighter-than-air gas to lift into the air. This appears to be what inspired Weston when he named his company Lighter Than Air Research (LTA). Pathfinder 1\u2019s twelve Pipistrel electric motors\u2014powered by two 150-kilowatt diesel generators and 24 battery packs\u2014will propel the aircraft, swiveling from positive 180 degrees to negative 180 degrees and working alongside four fin rudders for directional control. Meanwhile, the nylon-based helium bags in Pathfinder 1\u2019s inner walls will lend lift and buoyancy.\n\n# All of this is held in by the aircraft\u2019s laminated Tedlar exterior. Pathfinder 1\u2019s skeleton consists of 13 circular mainframes, each consisting of 3,000 welded TITANIUM hubs and 10,000 polymer tubes reinforced with carbon fiber. These protect Pathfinder 1\u2019s helium bags, while an understated nose cone helps the airship withstand winds up to 80 miles per hour, or 70 knots.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019ll be a while before Pathfinder 1 reaches that type of speed, though. Wednesday\u2019s slow roll out of the hangar was just one baby step out of many when testing the aircraft. On the ground, the LTA team will see how the warmth brought about by sunrise affects the airship\u2019s one million cubic feet of helium. And when Pathfinder 1 finally lifts off, it\u2019ll only be a few feet off the ground. A mobile mast will ensure the airship doesn\u2019t go anywhere before it\u2019s ready.\u00a0\n\n The idea is for Pathfinder 1 to forge a new path for sustainable air travel. (This is what ultimately earned LTA more than $100 million in funding from Brin, whose [**philanthropy**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-22/billionaire-brin-sold-tesla-near-its-peak-for-new-giving-vehicle#xj4y7vzkg) largely focuses on climate change and public health.) It goes without saying that passenger or cargo flights are a long way off, though. LTA has until September 2024 to take advantage of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [**airworthiness certificate**](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-airship-faa-clearance), which grants the company permission to complete up to 50 test flights under 1,500 feet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (***Older Article Below is Relevant given Prudent Capitalist's Post Yesterday !)\n\n# Nov. 8, 2023 ~  Prudent Capitalist's Post -EXIM BANK UPDATE:\n\n***Positive News and Development: I frequently check the EXIM website to see if there is anything referencing our project or application. This morning, much to my surprise and delight, there was a new reference to Niocorp's (NB) Elk Creek project listing us as a \"Pending Transaction,\" as of November 8, 2023, which is today and listed as the \"Project Posting Date\". In fact, it appears to be referenced as a \"Pending Approved Transaction,\" but no one should believe it has actually been finally approved by the EXIM Board of Directors, which would be the final required approval. I tried to reach out to Jim Sims for more information, but he was out of the office. I thought this was important enough to call him. When I reached him, Jim indicated that he, Mark and Scott are out at the sight near Elk Creek working on the project, and they were actually at that time meeting with a Japanese Business News crew that was there doing a major story on the project. Jim stated that they have a lot of potential investors in Japan and that this was a very positive development. He also confirmed that NioCorp has moved beyond the very important first stage of being passed on by the Transaction Review Committee 1 (TRC 1), and that is the point where EXIM lists the transaction as \"pending\", but he emphasized that there are 2 more additional stages prior to Board of Directors approval. He did also emphasize that, to his knowledge, there has not previously been any applicant moving to this stage and not receiving final approval from the Board. But he noted that might not include any applicants that withdrew from the process due to finding other funding, etc. In any event, he stated this is a very big step. He stated EXIM will not allow Press Releases in the middle of the process, but that since I found this information on the EXIM website, he was permitted to discuss it and share additional information. Needless to say, this is a huge step and very positive development.

One aspect of my criticism was their long period of silence and lack of communication with investors, however as soon as I wrapped this up, Lucid announced their investors conference (with no Q&A) for July 13th, so I held off posting this until I hear the conference call. In fact, it is so exciting to see Lucid Groups is surrounded by so many fans, believers, and enthusiasts, however it is also a bit frightening to see so many Naysayers and skeptics this company has attracted. Both sides have their own reasons to hold on to their views, but we can\u2019t deny the role of Lucid Group\u2019s management in the war between the good side and the bad side. After all, they ultimately add lots of weight to one side of the game and determine the winner. The ugly part is that they have so far added lots of weight to skeptics with their \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver\u201d strategy.\n\nThe conference call was followed by +15% drop in CCIV stock price during the following days, a similar pattern we have seen after previous conference calls held by Peter Rawlinson. The conference call had plenty of interesting updates, including the 500K EV sales projections for 2030, which implies 50% YoY EV volume growth between 2022 and 2030, but it didn\u2019t excite investors. How come the 2030 EV volume projection can be taken seriously while the management can\u2019t even predict and announce which month in 2H\u20192021 the first delivery is going to happen? We are already 2 weeks into Q2\u20192021. If the crash test is completed and EPA range testing is underway, shouldn\u2019t the management be able to at least project which month the first customer delivery will take place? Is it August? Is it December?  The same is true about Lucid ESS prototype testing progress. It has made outstanding progress, and according to the management the ESS business roadmap is on track, but how will it impact the top line in 2022 or 2023?  It was wonderful to briefly hear Sherry House\u2019s voice for the first time following her second months into her role as the CFO, yet it would be nice if she shed more lights on how the expansion and acceleration of planned Capex in 2021 \u2013 2023 would affect 2021-2022 production (EV volume) and sales figures? The management\u2019s narrative has never explained how the 577 EV volume in 2H\u2019 2021 will transform to 20K volume in 2022? Is it because of the completion of a big milestone at AMP-1 manufacturing facility construction? Is it an underpromise / overdeliver scheme of 2021? We hear the sheer excitement in Mr. Rawlinson\u2019s voice when he talks about Tesla commanding the $600B market cap because of the efficiency metrics (Mi/kWh) that he values the most and he claims Lucid to be the forefront at it. However, it\u2019s good to note that Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk has fought a decade long battle with naysayers and skeptics to get to where he is right now, he kept overpromising and underdelivering for almost a decade, and only when he overpromised AND overdelivered, he could win the battle against anyone who was betting against him. He has had such an eye-popping victory that he can easily hide the true market cap of his company \\[$757B and not 600B, based on fully diluted shares as of July 13th\\] from public eyes and even from his rivals. It is not that he is personally trying to hide as much as GM & Ford market cap (combined) every single day, but the investing public apparently don\u2019t really care even if they happened to know it. On the other hand, investing public calculate Lucid market cap through CCIV stock price with the highest obsession and precision based on the fully diluted shares, and apparently every single dollar counts! Furthermore, Tesla\u2019s fully diluted shares have increased +13% over the past five quarters and rarely anyone knows this fact, while investing public are concerned about \\~ 6% dilution effect of the next round of capital raising and share issuance at the end of 2022 for Lucid. I don\u2019t believe the different treatment these two companies get from the investing public would have anything to do with efficiency metrics or other engineering metrics (power to weight, i.e 9 horsepower per kg) that Mr. Rawlinson is pointing to. Don\u2019t get me wrong. These metrics and technology excellence are astounding achievements by Lucid\u2019s engineering and R&D teams, but they are way more fascinating for engineers than the general investing public. Therefore a smart engineer such as Mr. Rawlinson might be so intrigued by these breakthrough technology achievements while general investing public might not initially appreciate their value, but the bigger risk is that the brilliant engineer believes these technological accomplishments are simply enough to define and justify the value of a company. This is the reason why there is a mismatch between announcing these innovations in technical terms by Lucid\u2019s CTO (who is also the CEO) and the price movement on the screen following those announcements. I believe there are two key elements that might address the mismatch between investors\u2019 expectations and Lucid management\u2019s approach to public relations: **Ecosystem** and **Story Telling (presentation and persuasion).**\n\nTesla is on its path to create an ecosystem that is not only limited to sustainable energy ecosystem. Tesla and its fans have persuaded the investing public that its innovations and disruptions will reach segments far from the core EV business, such as software, energy storage and AD. The eye-popping victory of Elon Musk over those who have been betting against him for a decade has resulted in the extreme optimism by investing public who assume that Tesla will disrupt other businesses way too far from its core business. The delusion has gone so far that Wall St. analysts assume Tesla will have an insurance business as big as Progressive in 9 years or mobility business segment as big as Uber by 2030. None of these two segments even exist today but they are priced in Tesla\u2019s market cap and price targets. This is one reason I would take Tesla\u2019s market cap with a grain of salt and would not tie Lucid\u2019s market cap to it, since a reset in Tesla\u2019s valuations might adversely affect Lucid.\n\nI am sure Mr. Rawlinson has noticed how eagerly investing public is waiting for any partnership or collaboration between Lucid and Apple. This expectation has overshadowed any communication from Mr. Rawlinson in the past several months. It is also obvious that Mr. Rawlinson has received the message. In his latest investor conference call, he emphasized that former Apple executives are leading the Lucid software R&D and that the product is an excellent integration of hardware and software, like the iPhone. I think Mr. Rawlinson needs to look at the bigger picture. Investing public would like to see Lucid being integrated into the ecosystem that guarantees its success. Collaboration with Apple on software could be one example of such integration (and likely the most assuring type of integration and success guarantee), however the potential is not limited to Apple. Lucid Group\u2019s \u201cTechnology segment\u201d makes it possible for Lucid to start licensing its technology to legacy OEMs and to open the gates for additional revenue stream and further integration. Collaborations on R&D or even marketing collaboration with big players are other examples of such integration. Even though Lucid might not even need Apple for AD software R&D collaboration, it doesn\u2019t mean Lucid can\u2019t provide signs of integration into the ecosystem through other means. The integration could be as big as partnership with the bluest blue-chip firms or be as small as having Lucid Air as an important theme in a high grossing movie. Isn\u2019t Lucid Air the most efficient and the most powerful EV in the world? Smith & Wesson sold hundreds of thousands of revolvers after Dirty Harry introduced the most powerful handgun that existed at the time. Big marketing campaigns, revenue generating deals, blue chip partnerships and collaborations are easier said than done, we all know, but the investing public is thirsty for further signs of Lucid\u2019s integration into the ecosystem. So, it is not just about Apple, it is not even about M&As either (no one expects that); the investing public don\u2019t like to see that Lucid Groups is single-handedly kicking ball in its own world as a niche luxury EV maker. They like to see further integration into this ecosystem. Mr.Rawlinson spoke about his interest in eVTOL and Lucid Technology application in aircrafts, marine, agricultural and heavy industrial machinery. What about deals with big industrial companies such as Deere or CAT? Mr.Rawlinson told us that the energy storage alpha prototype testing is on track and they have plans for their beta prototype. What about deals with big retail stores such as Walmart or Target on that front? Even if it is very pre-mature to think about a definitive deal, Lucid could sign framework agreements with those companies that keep the door open for purchase orders to come in down the road. It is not about Apple at all, Lucid\u2019s topnotch technology and innovations could prove numerous signs of integration into the ecosystem to give investing public more confidence and a different image of the company. The image of Lucid \u201cGroup\u201d, not just a niche luxury EV company. This is the image that Elon Musk has sent to the investing public, that Tesla is not just an EV company but a tech company. They have provided a few signs of building an ecosystem and integrating into the current ecosystem and the public has been persuaded to the point that they assume and price in plenty of revenue streams that do not even exist. In addition to that, Tesla has made another ecosystem of customer / shareholders. The shareholders became customers (many of them buying several Tesla EVs in the family) and customers who become shareholders. This vision is not exclusive to Tesla. Xpeng CEO listed their shares on HK stock exchange late June. He said,\n\n*\u201cBut in the long run though, we would like to have a listing venue that get us closer to home because we\u2019re a consumer brand in China.* ***Ultimately we want our customers to be our shareholders***\\*, and having the dual primary listing status in HK (Hong Kong) will give us eligibility to be connected to Chinese capital markets\\*.\u201d [Xpeng IPO: Chinese Tesla rival closes flat in Hong Kong debut (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/xpeng-ipo-shares-of-chinese-tesla-rival-rise-on-hong-kong-debut-.html)\n\nOnly if Lucid management adopted this strategic insight, they would make some changes in their investor communication and their approach to public relations. Currently tens of thousands of retail investors have become hardcore believers of Lucid Group and have invested heavily on CCIV SPAC. The company would be wise to enhance their communication methods with retail investors and would be wise to constantly keep them excited. Retail investors are important and powerful players in the market these days. Retail investors should not be underestimated or ignored, Retail investors are so powerful that they have provided the best turnaround opportunity for few companies that were on the brink of bankruptcy and have obsolete business models. These companies could successfully leverage retail investors\u2019 excitement. Each individual plays multiple roles for these companies, the role of an investor (capital providers), a customer and an ambassador. Unlike those companies, Lucid is at the forefront of electrification and sustainability, the most important trends of 21st century. Lucid has the best and most advanced technology, has the best and brightest human capital, has been provided substantial capital by CCIV and PIPE deals and is backed by one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds. Lucid is going public in a prime period that, from valuation perspective, innovative and green tech companies are treated with utmost leniency in capital markets and EVs are the hottest revolutionary trends in the investment world (and a few even call it EV Mania Period). This means that all the winds in the world are blowing in the direction Lucid Group is sailing to. If in this environment Lucid fails to thrill and persuade the investing public, there will be no other period the company can as easily persuade or excite them. The second element that plays pivotal role in persuasion is **presentation (story telling)**. I believe it is currently the most vulnerable feature of Lucid management.\n\nTesla is the master of storytelling. Elon Musk has gone so far in storytelling and stimulating imaginations, that have enabled him to design Cybertruck, a truck model that according to him might end up being a flop, but it enthralls him nonetheless. With his presentations, Elon Musk has persuaded the whole world that Tesla is a behemoth tech company far beyond EVs, that it is creating an ecosystem that it can play role in any part of it in the future, so lots of those imaginations and excitements have been priced in Tesla\u2019s stock, enabling the company to sell the investing public the weirdest products, designs and ideas as the futuristic innovation, without being questioned much. Tesla\u2019s presentations have resulted in the kind of persuasion that penetrates way beyond the subject of presentation. Lucid management\u2019s presentations usually end in the opposite direction. The management announces fabulous engineering achievements, reveals astonishing features of their EVs and present the technology that is second to none, yet the presentation fails to excite the investing public, the majority of announcements go surprisingly unnoticed and there is a mismatch between the announcements and price movement. For example, on July 13th, Mr. Rawlinson revealed the technology behind the car headlamps, inspired by insect eyes. It went completely unnoticed. What difference would it make if Jay Leno drove in the car with Mr. Rawlinson late afternoon on Big Sur Coastal Route in front of the camera and the innovative headlamps functionalities were broadcasted to the public on a recorded program, featuring comments from Jay Leno and Mr. Rawlinson together? Wouldn\u2019t the investing public and customers remember it better that way instead of hearing it on a pre-recorded conference call? Or instead of repeating the fusion of hardware/software in conference calls and emphasizing on HMI experience, wouldn\u2019t it be better if Mr. Rawlinson took a 500-mile trip from Bay area to LA through Cabrillo Highway (Route 1) on a recorded program with his compatriots Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson? Wouldn\u2019t these four gentlemen together visualize and broadcast the HMI (Human Machine Interface), space concept and user experience to customers and investing public better than a pre-recorded conference call? I am sure Lucid Management would agree that comments from three well-known British motorsport broadcasters along with Mr. Rawlinson pointing to many of those engineering metrics (efficiency, aerodynamics, power to weight ratio, etc) would go much farther than being presented on a pre-recorded call. After all, people around the world have grown up with many of these well-known motorsport reviewers and car broadcasters, these journalists and program hosts are expert at transferring the driving feelings and experience to the audience through motion pictures and comments. Furthermore, they have millions of followers on social media that will be attracted to Lucid. Lucid Air is a pure example of a supercar, the best luxury EV in the world and yet if Alexandra Mary Hirschi (known as Supercar Blondie) got her hands on this beauty for 5 minutes, she could let tens of millions of her viewers and followers feel the car on their screens. Doesn\u2019t the product define brand according to Mr. Rawlinson? Yet why this product isn\u2019t yet in the hands of reviewers after completing the crash and safety tests? Why isn\u2019t this product on the monitors or cellphone screens of millions of people? Lucid has around 170K followers on different social media platforms which could be considered an incredibly low recognition. The faster pace of brand awareness and capturing market share require a much stronger, much more aggressive marketing strategy and campaigns. According to Mr. Rawlinson\\*,\u201d And the product is the essential foundation for the brand. I believe that product defines brands more than brand defines product\\*\u201d Yet this product is only out there on billboards and standstill in studios, not in motion, not on consumer-engaging videos and not on the screens of millions of people. The mediocre presentation and storytelling strength of Lucid Motors adversely affects its persuasion power. We will probably see some hints of persuasion power when Rivian gets closer to their IPO date, if they pursue the $70B valuation for their IPO. They will definitely need to bend over backwards to persuade investing public for such valuation at their IPO. Lucid management might grasp a few persuasion tactics for their playbook then.\n\nThe bottom line is, the underpromising and overdelivering strategy is an extremely dangerous and ugly policy if Lucid needs to gain traction in its first year. There has been no company targeted with more rumors, misinformation and lies than Lucid Group and there has been no targeted company that could successfully fight off the naysayers passively by letting the product and technology speak for themselves. No company has ever won over those who bet against it by underpromising and applying a dovish tone. Underpromise / overdeliver strategy has contributed significantly to Lucid\u2019s lost allure. No company can expect hefty valuations while underpromising and adopting a dovish stance. This approach attracts more and more naysayers, short sellers and negativity rather than believers and supporters. **Tesla-like success needs overpromising and still overdelivering. It requires high bars and the management that jumps even higher.** Furthermore, no company has ever made the brand with hard-to-access products displayed behind the glass walls, with secrecy coupled with lackluster marketing strategy. The product and technology don\u2019t speak for themselves if the management can\u2019t persuade and excite the public about its sucess. If the company keeps the current strategy, it won\u2019t be able to sustain its valuation and the investing public will eventually lose far more interest in Lucid Group. If Lucid keeps underpromising and holds the dovish tone, the expectations and valuations will adjust and the company will need several years to grow into its current valuation and its overall success might be adversely affected, thus persuading the public about the image it tries to broadcast will remain a lucid dream for its management, and likely a hectic nightmare for its investors.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, several investment banks and sell side analysts (i.e. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Goldman, JP Morgan, UBS, AB, etc) will publish their reports and price targets for LCID. It all depends on Peter Rawlinson's \"**PERSUASION POWER\"**, how he persuades the investing public\\*\\* (both institutional and retail investors) about Lucid and justifies the market cap. If he can persuade the investing public, they will price in his visions and plans in the stock and give \"overweight/buy\" rating, if he fails to persuade them, Lucid might get \"underweight / sell\" rating with much lower 12 month price target.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*\\* P.S.

By selecting the best water pump for aquaponics, farmers can enhance the efficiency and productivity of their systems, ultimately leading to healthier crops and fish while at the same time reducing maintenance frequency. Aquaponics is an innovative system that combines **aquaculture** and **hydroponics**, allowing for the sustainable cultivation of plants and fish in a **symbiotic** environment. In this article, we will delve into the various factors to consider when choosing a water pump, highlighting the top options available on the market and providing insights into their features and performance. Additionally, we will share a real-life success story of a farmer who significantly improved their aquaponics system by selecting the right water pump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Submersible Aquaponics Water Pump](https://preview.redd.it/kcd2a4d6pbwb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=97da728b0385162352695f132b56324fcc657b95)\n\n## Key takeaway:\n\n### Choose the right water pump:\u00a0\n\n* When selecting a water pump for your aquaponics system, consider factors such as **flow rate 2 - 4 times the tank size per hour, head height reducing flow rate, power consumption, inlet size, pump location in or outside the water, and durability**. Ensuring that the water pump meets the specific requirements of your system will contribute to its overall efficiency and success.\n\n### Less maintenance:\u00a0\n\n* Larger dirty water pumps can be used for big systems to reduce clogged inlets. You can also consider building a coarse dirt filter to prevent clogging.\u00a0\n\n### Consider energy efficiency:\u00a0\n\n* Opt for water pumps that are energy-efficient to minimize electricity consumption and reduce operating costs. If your pump is in the water, the extra power will heat your system. Depending on the pump's efficiency, 30 to 60% of the pump\u2019s power will be converted into heat and partially replace water heaters. You may want to look for models with variable speed controls, as they allow for better water flow control for your grow bed. External pumps, depending on design, will mainly heat the air around them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n### Proper maintenance is essential:\u00a0\n\n* Regularly clean and monthly maintain your water pump to prolong its lifespan and prevent blockages or damage. This includes inspecting and cleaning the impeller, checking for leaks, and ensuring proper water flow throughout the system.\n\n### Consider additional stream pumps for your aquaponics system:\u00a0\n\n* Complimentary to your grow bed water pump, consider adding stream pumps for your fish. As they increase their swimming activity, they exercise the fish and multiply the felt living space of the fish because they have to swim against the current. Most fish prefer strong currents in crowded spaces more than the tension built up in still water. Larger systems require more powerful water pumps to ensure adequate water circulation and oxygenation.\n\n### Noise level and durability:\u00a0\n\n* Pay attention to the noise level of the water pump, especially if your aquaponics system is located inside your living area. Pumps that are located in the water are usually quieter. Additionally, choose a water pump that is durable and designed to withstand continuous use in water environments, and check for winter compatibility if your system is outside.\n\n### Consider the power source:\u00a0\n\n* Depending on your setup and location, choose a water pump that is compatible with your available power source. Options include electric pumps, solar-powered pumps, and battery-operated pumps. 12V pumps are very safe compared to 120V or 220V, and if you have an unused old PC power supply, you can recycle that to deliver power to your 12V air and water pump. There will be no risk to fish and humans in case of a leakage.\n\nBonus tip for the lazy: Invest some money in a mechanical timer and set it to run every one to three hours for 15 - 30 minutes. I had problems with electronic timer because the reversing water flow in the pipes when the pumps turned off induced electricity from the back spinning rotors and regularly caused freezing or errors in the electric programable timers. The watering cycle will depend on your grow bed type, size, and your plant's needs. With more fish, you can increase the frequency of flooding the grow bed or run a second pump to a second grow bed with a second timer that alternates every half hour. Certainly, this will improve the fish tank water quality with heavily occupied fish stock.\n\n**How to Calculate the Correct Water Pump Size for Your System**\n\nDetermining the appropriate water pump size for your aquaponics system requires careful consideration. Follow this 4-step guide to ensure you choose the correct size:\n\n1. Calculate the total volume of water in your system: Measure the total volume of water in your aquaponics setup, including fish tanks and any other components that hold water. This will give you an idea of the water volume that the pump will need to handle.\n2. Determine the desired flow rate: Consider the specific needs of your system, such as the type of plants you are growing and the species of fish you are keeping. The drier the needs for the plant, the more time you will want in between the flooding periods. The fish on the other want more frequent filtering by flooding the grow bed. The more dirt your fish produce and the more fish you have the more often you want to flood. For the beginning, you can start with every three-hour running pump the for 15 minutes. So you go for dry plants then you should use 4 times the water size of your tank. For plants that don\u2019t mind a little water you can go for a water pump with 2 times the water volume per hour output. If the fish tank dirt increases, you can increase it to every two-hour run for 15 minutes. On the other hand, if the plants prefer drier conditions, you can also increase the time to 4 or even 6 hours. Usually, the ideal flow rate lies between 2 - 4 times running the water through the whole system. There are big differences in the pump size if you plan on heavily stocking your aquaponics system compared to a low-stock system. Buy bigger pumps with adjustable flow rates if you are unsure which pump to choose for your particular setup to ensure optimal conditions for both **plants** and **fish and expandability for many big fish**.\n3. Consider head height and pipe diameter: To choose the perfect pump for your system, you have to know the pump's flow rate for your head height. Take into account the head height, which is the vertical distance between the water level of your fish tank and the highest point in your system where the water needs to be delivered. Additionally, consider the diameter of the pipes you will be using not to have them as a constraining factor. Over time, a thin biofilm will occupy your pump inlet and water pipes, so add 10 to 20% to your calculated GPH (Gallon Per Hour) of your pump and pipe diameter. Combined, these factors will affect the overall pump performance and efficiency.\n4. Select a pump with big inlet filters: Using the information gathered in the previous steps, choose a water pump that meets the required flow rate and can handle the head height of your system, preferably one with good debris handling. Remember that when the pumps turn off, the pumped-up water in the pipe flows back, cleaning the inlet to some degree, depending on your head height and pipe diameter. Make sure not to make a science out of it; probably, any pump can make your system work in the beginning, as small fish don\u2019t put out any noticeable waste. Be sure to account for any potential expansion of your system in the future, where you will buy bigger pumps and can use the old pumps for stream pumps in the fish tank or garden irrigation.\n\nIt is important to note that each aquaponics system is unique, and there may be additional factors to consider based on your specific setup. You can ask questions in the comments, and I try to answer them all for further guidance tailored to your system that I have not mentioned yet.\n\nWhen selecting a water pump, consider energy efficiency, noise levels, and the overall reliability of the pump. A properly sized pump will ensure efficient water circulation, oxygenation, and nutrient distribution throughout your aquaponics system, promoting healthy plant growth and **fish** health.\n\nRemember, choosing the correct water pump size is crucial for the success of your aquaponics system. By following these guidelines and consulting with experts, you can ensure optimal performance and maximize the potential of your system.\n\n## Aquaponics Water Pump Location Inside or Outside the Tank\n\n### In-Tank Submerged Pumps\n\nDesigned to operate while fully immersed in water, in-tank pumps are often situated within the fish or sump tank. They are commonly chosen for more compact aquaponics systems. These pumps work by drawing water in and then expelling it. Here's their operational breakdown:\n\n1. Intake Mechanism: Positioned at the base of the pump is an intake filter or screen. This ensures debris doesn't enter the pump while water is drawn in.\n2. Rotor: The core of the pump houses a rotor\u2014a spinning element with blades. When activated, the rotor's rapid rotation creates a force that drives the water through the pump.\n3. Discharge Point: Post rotor, the water is channeled through an exit pipe or hose, distributing it to the grow beds or other system parts.\n\n#### Advantages:\n\n* Simple to set up, in-tank pumps mostly evade intricate plumbing due to their in-water placement.\n* They are generally more budget-friendly compared to their external counterparts.\n* Safer than external pumps when any unexpected leaks happen.\n* Operating silently, in-tank pumps are ideal for setups indoors or closer to living areas.\n* Pump heat is transferred into the water\n* Nothing outside the fish tank resulting in a cleaner look\n* No need for pre filter\n\n#### Drawbacks:\n\n* Being in the fish tank exposes these pumps to potential blockages from fish waste and other debris if the inlet is bad, which may necessitate adding a self-made prefilter or regular cleaning if the inlet is not well protected.\n* Their capacity in terms of flow rate and lift height might be limited, affecting the system's scalability when building bigger set ups.\n* Uses minute space in the fish tank.\n\n### External Pumps\n\nOften referred to as centrifugal pumps, these are positioned outside the fish tank and are a preferred choice for expansive aquaponics systems. Their robust motors are adept at circulating substantial water quantities. Unlike their submersible counterparts, external pumps are quantified in horsepower. Here's their functioning:\n\n1. Suction Point: Water from the fish or sump tank is suctioned into the pump through an inlet hose.\n2. Rotor: Similar to in-tank pumps, external ones also use a rotor that, upon spinning, propels the water.\n3. Discharge Point: Post the rotor, water is directed to the desired parts of the system through an exit pipe or hose.\n\n#### Advantages:\n\n* Being outside the fish tank, these pumps are less exposed to debris, which translates to reduced maintenance.\n* Their ability to handle higher flow rates and greater lift capacities makes them apt for larger, more intricate aquaponics configurations.\n* Their positioning outside water, away from potential corrosive agents, augments their longevity.\n* Doesn\u2019t take up space in the tank.\n* Pump heat dissipates into the air which may be good in hot climates.\n\n#### Drawbacks:\n\n* Setting up external pumps might demand a more comprehensive plumbing arrangement.\n* They usually come with a heftier price tag compared to in-tank models.\n* The noise they produce might require soundproofing, especially if the system is inside or adjacent to living spaces.\n* Might need prefilter\n* Loss of temperature in cold climates.\n* More prone to leaks\n\n## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Water Pump for Aquaponics Systems\n\nWhen selecting a **water pump** for **aquaponics systems**, there are several crucial factors to keep in mind. These considerations play a significant role in ensuring the optimal functioning and efficiency of the system. Here are five key points to consider:\n\n* **Flow Rate:** Consider the desired flow rate of water within the system. This will depend on the size of the aquaponics setup and the specific needs of the plants and fish being grown.\n* **Head Height:** Take into account the vertical distance the water needs to be lifted. The pump should have enough power to overcome the elevation and maintain adequate water circulation.\n* **Power Consumption:** Evaluate the energy usage of the water pump. Opt for a pump that is energy-efficient to minimize operational costs and environmental impact.\n* **Durability:** Look for a water pump that is made from high-quality materials and is designed to withstand the demands of aquaponics systems. This ensures longevity and reduces the need for frequent replacements.\n* **Noise Level:** Consider the noise level produced by the water pump. For indoor aquaponics setups, a quiet pump is essential to maintain a peaceful environment. But usually this doesn\u2019t matter because air pumps tend to be lot louder than water pumps in home sized aquaponics.\n* Power source: Solar or wind powered battery are an option for outside use without power outlet.\n* Water Inlet: Bigger inlets tend to block less often.\n* Buying Bigger Pumps than necessary: You can regulate down while also got enough room for eventual biofilm build up which lessen flowrate over time. Also bigger pumps tend to have bigger inlets which makes them more clogresistant.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to assess other unique details that have not been covered already. This includes factors specific to your aquaponics system, such as the availability of backup power sources or the compatibility of the water pump with other equipment like Arduino and other types of automation and electronic regulation. The automation with arduino and humidity sensors could create optimal automated ebb and flooding for picky plants and easier to regulate for different climate zones and weather.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect and clean the water pump to prevent clogging and maintain optimal performance. You can also check if your grow beds are still wet and your fish tank is free of debris.\n\n## Water Pump Setup and Maintaining Guidelines\n\nProper setup and regular upkeep of your water pump are essential for its optimal performance and durability. Follow these comprehensive guidelines:\n\n### Setting Up Your Pump\n\n1. Choose the Right Spot: Depending on the pump type, place submersible pumps inside the fish or sump tank and inline pumps outside.\n2. Connect Inlet and Outlet: Follow manufacturer guidelines to attach the inlet and outlet tubes or hoses.\n3. Priming Inline Pumps: Some inline pumps need priming. Fill them with water to ensure a smooth start by aiding suction.\n4. Integration with Aquaponics: Connect an optional pre-filter to prevent clogging to your inlet and submerse the inlet. Link the outlet of your pump with the grow bed of your aquaponics setup, ensuring water is directed appropriately.\n5. Ensure Electrical Safety: If your pump needs electricity from a power outlet, connect it to a GFCI outlet and ensure proper grounding. For maximum fish and human safety you should consider buying a 12V pump with a power adapter.\n6. Activate and Test for Leaks: Monitor connections for any leaks after turning on the pump. If spotted, turn off the pump and address the issue to avoid potential risks. For grow beds directly above the fish tank, some leaking is no problem and will most likely stop because, over time, debris and fish waste build up.\n7. Observe the Water Flow. Adjust as needed to suit your fish and grow bed.\n\n### Routine Upkeep Recommendations\n\n1. Intake Cleaning: For in-tank pumps, check the intake filter for clogging or screen the grow bed regularly for moisture to notice potential pump blockages. External pumps might have a pre-filter that needs periodic cleaning if the head height is low and less water flows back out of the inlet to clean it.\n2. Check the Rotor: Periodically inspect the rotor for any debris or obstructions, cleaning or replacing if needed.\n3. Lubricate When Needed: Some pumps might need occasional lubrication. Always refer to the user manual.\n4. Review Seals: Regularly check gaskets, seals, and joints for potential leaks, replacing any worn-out parts.\n5. Keep Pipelines Clear: Ensure that connected hoses or pipes are clean and obstruction-free which usually happens at pipe connections where the radius is the smallest.\n6. Monitor Sound Levels: An increase in pump noise could hint at a rotor issue or maintenance requirement\n7. Overheating: Sand or metall particle blocking and grinding inside the motor and causing overheating which might destroy the magnet of your pump resulting in weaker pump performance or starting difficulties to total failure.\u00a0\n8. Routine Inspections: Dedicate time for regular pump checks and maintenance as this will save you from most bigger problems like fish death and stunted plant growth. If you notice your water pump is reliable you can reduce the inspection frequency.\u00a0\n\nAddressing Common Aquaponics Water Pump Challenges\u00a0\n\n#### Pump Doesn't Start:\n\n* Verify power connectivity.\n* Ensure no blockages or clogs in the pump.\n* Turn off the pump and clean the pre-filter, the pump inlet and take out the motor and clean the magnet where usually the propeller sits on and use a cotton swab to clean the pump head inside. Try to remove any potential sand, small stones or metall particles which could potentially damage your pump irrevocably\n* If the motor still stands still after cleaning the pump completely try to use a toothpick to kickstart the pump\n* For external types, ensure correct priming.\n\n#### Reduced Water Flow:\n\n* Confirm rotor and intake are clear.\n* Detect and fix any air leaks in the intake.\n* Make sure your pump's size matches system needs.\n\n#### High Noise Levels:\n\n* Look for rotor obstructions or wear.\n* Confirm the pump is stable and not causing undue vibrations.\n* Lubricate if specified by the manufacturer.\n\n#### Identifying Leaks:\n\n* Secure all connection points.\n* Swap out worn seals or gaskets.\n* Double-check the firmness of all plumbing links.\n\nFor our recommended Pump List click here\n\n[https://unimother.de/blogs/aquaponics/aquaponics-water-pump](https://unimother.de/blogs/aquaponics/aquaponics-water-pump)\n\n## FAQs about Best Aquaponics Water Pumps\n\n### 1.

How does it make a difference? Read on to find out!\n\nFor our reverse osmosis filter recommendations, click here:\n\n[https://unimother.de/blogs/household/reverse-osmosis-filter](https://unimother.de/blogs/household/reverse-osmosis-filter)\n\n## Saving Money, Time, Work, Medical Bills, Retarded Children\n\nClearly, using osmosis filters instead of buying bottled water can save you money and time. You would buy and transport it from the supermarket and also carry tons of water per year. Plus, water is super heavy, which means extra transport costs from the supermarket to your home using more gasoline to fuel your car. So, osmosis filters are a win for your wallet and the planet. Make the switch today! You'll be amazed at how great osmosis-filtered water tastes, and your pets will notice the difference, too.\n\nWater filters also reduce the waste from plastic bottles and caps, and supermarkets require less logistics to transport bottled water to hydrate the people.\n\nThis calculation does not even consider how much money you save on medical bills for hospitals and psychologists in the long run and the money you make from mental clarity and focus as well as increased IQ and physical strength gained. We must also consider that our children will become more intelligent and stronger and what impact that would have on society in the long run when all people worldwide would benefit in the same way.\n\nWhat do you think would happen when we as a society became more healthy, intelligent, and physically fit? Comment down below.\n\nNow, you might say I\u2019m exaggerating. Read on, and I will prove it to you with facts and studies.\n\n## Cost Analysis of Using Osmosis Filters vs. Bottled Water.\n\nDitch the bottled water and go for an osmosis filter. It's way healthier, economical, and environmentally friendly. This calculation does not even include the unpaid hours of waiting in line, being a water carrier, and an Uber driver while also having to pay fuel for all that. Let's have a look at the cost difference. Here's a table:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Time Period**|**Cost of Osmosis Filters (USD)**|**Cost of Bottled Water (USD)**|**Plastic Bottles + Caps + Cap Rings + Label Foils**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1 Month|$40|$136|91|\n|6 Months|$240|$820|547|\n|1 Year|$480|$1640|1095|\n\nThe lifespan of the reverse osmosis membrane typically ranges from two to five years. On the other hand, the accompanying filters in the RO system usually require replacement earlier. Pre-filters for the RO system typically have a duration of six months to a year, but this can vary based on the water conditions in your region. Primarily, the chlorine affects the activated carbon and will destroy the silicate membrane if the carbon is saturated. A high mineral content will clog the membrane faster, and lastly, your filter change frequency will depend on how much water you filter and what water you have.\n\nFor calculation purposes, I just used the prices for dirtier water with high filter change frequency.\n\nAlso, notice the price for an osmosis filter gets cheaper when you use more water because bigger models can filter more water through one filter's lifecycle.\n\nThe calculation is based on one person consuming \u00bd gallon per day per person. The average Single-Use Water Bottle holds a volume of 16.9 oz (500 mL) and costs $1.50 each.\n\n## Taste and Purity: Differences Between Osmosis Filtered Water and Bottled Water.\n\nResearching the quality differences between osmosis-filtered and bottled water will help us understand their impact on taste and purity. Examining factors like mineral content, impurities, and taste profiles will give us a deeper insight.\n\nBelow is a comparison table for the main distinctions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Criteria**|**Osmosis Filtered Water**|**Bottled Water**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mineral Content|Reduced minerals for more control over minerals and hydration separately|Varies by brand, but usually high in Calcium and lower in many other essential micronutrients|\n|Impurities|Removes harmful contaminants, drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, chemicals, and many other pollutions|It may have heavy metals, chemicals, and many other pollutions, plastic leaching over long time|\n|Taste|Refreshing taste, no unpleasant aftertaste. Your body and pets will know what\u2019s good, given the choice.|Taste varies by source, brand, and bottle, but tainted taste by plastic and impurities|\n\nOsmosis-filtered water has a cleaner taste due to its reduced mineral content. This lets your body regulate how much water and minerals it needs. You may find yourself drinking more water due to its better taste.\n\nTo make the most of your water-drinking experience, consider these tips:\n\n1. Use osmosis filters at home. This means you can access clean water without relying solely on bottled water.\n2. Try different bottled water brands. This helps you find a taste that suits your preferences and meets quality standards if osmosis filters are no option for you.\n3. Invest in reusable glass bottles. This helps reduce plastic waste and promotes sustainability and health. Beware of reusing glass bottles with metal caps, as the aluminum or steel wears off in small amounts on repeated use and causes Alzheimer-like symptoms and less addiction control.\n\nThese tips help maintain a consistent supply of water, reduce reliance on single-use plastics, and find a preferred taste. Osmosis water filters are like having a personal hydration bodyguard so that you can drink clean water like a superhero!\n\n## How does an Osmosis Water Filter work?\n\nA simple osmosis water filter is a great way to purify your drinking water. It works with either cellulose acetate or polysulfone coated with an aromatic polyamide membrane and prefiltered with activated carbon filter technology to remove impurities and contaminants. Here's how:\n\nBooster Pump (Optional)\n\nIncreases the water pressure to filter the water source without the required water pressure to operate the osmosis filter.\n\nPreliminary Filtration:\n\nLarger particles like sediment and debris are filtered out.\n\nActivated Carbon Adsorption:\n\nOrganic compounds, chlorine, and other reactive chemicals that may harm the membrane are adsorbed by the carbon, which also improves the taste and odor of the water.\n\nMembrane Filtration:\n\nRemoves up to 99.9% of contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, chemicals, microplastics, hormones like birth control, and heavy metals are trapped by a semi-permeable membrane with microscopic pores.\n\nPermeate Pump (Optional)\n\nUses retentate to power a hydraulic pump, which increases the effectiveness of the osmosis filter, which increases flow rate and permeate to rentate water ratio when using pressurized water tanks.\n\nRemineralization (Optional):\n\nThe purified water may go through remineralization to restore some essential minerals.\n\nStorage Tank For Permeate Water\n\nOsmosis filter releases water slowly. Bigger water tanks can extend the time between filtering cycles. Most tanks release some chemicals into the water, so post-carbon filtering is recommended.\n\nStorage Tank For Reject Water (Optional)\n\nBrine water can be used for toilet flushing, pre-car wash water, or cleaning dishes. It shouldn\u2019t be used for plant watering or washing machines because of its high mineral content.\n\nPotable Pump for Stored Water (Optional)\n\nMoves water from your storage tank to the faucet or other connections. You can also set the storage tank higher and use gravity to fill glass bottles.\n\nActivated Carbon Post Filter (Optional)\n\nRefines the water by removing any tastes or odors it may have acquired from the storage tank or water pump. Specifically, systems lacking the Artesian Full Contact technology produce acidic water that can leach compounds from the rubber in the storage tank, which this final filter effectively eliminates.\n\nUV light Post Treatment (Optional)\n\nA UV filter eliminates microorganisms, while specific filters target and remove residual amounts of contaminants such as nitrates, arsenic, fluoride, and ions through deionization.\n\n## Booster Pump (Optional):\n\n* Mechanism: Utilizes a combination of diaphragm and electric motor to amplify pressure.\n* Maintenance: Over time, the diaphragm may wear out and require replacement. Regularly check for signs of reduced efficiency.\n\n## Preliminary Filtration:\n\n* Varieties: Apart from sediment filters, there are pleated, spun, or string-wound variants catering to different water qualities.\n* Micron Rating: Filters come in different micron ratings, indicating the size of particles they can block. A lower micron rating denotes finer filtration.\n\n## Activated Carbon Adsorption:\n\nActivated charcoal has been used for its ability to filter water naturally. Its porous nature allows it to bind with various contaminants, including toxins, drugs, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and a range of chemicals, much like it absorbs substances in the gastrointestinal system.\n\nIn industrial settings, like waste management facilities, activated carbon granules are a common choice for a stage of the water purification process. Additionally, there are numerous water filtration devices available for residential use that employ carbon cartridges to cleanse water from toxins and other harmful substances. This is important to know because the skin and oral mucosa can absorb drugs, chemicals, chlorine, and fluoride. Especially when exposed to it on a daily basis. Therefore, consider filtering your shower and bathroom water with activated carbon to limit exposure to those toxins.\n\nResearch from 2015 has indicated that carbon-based water filtration systems can be highly effective. For instance, [in the study, such systems eliminated up to 100 percent of fluoride present](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623834/) in 32 samples of water that were not filtered, demonstrating this result after the systems had been operating for six months.\n\n* Types: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) and Block Activated Carbon (BAC) are primary forms. BAC usually offers finer filtration than GAC.\n* Lifespan: Over time, the carbon gets saturated and loses its adsorption ability. Regularly scheduled replacements are vital to protect the membrane.\n\n## Activated Carbon Usage Besides Water Filtration\n\nActivated charcoal is a versatile substance approved by the World Health Organization for the emergency treatment of poisonings and overdoses. [Its powerful toxin-absorbing properties have led to its suggestion for various health issues](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322609#possible-uses), although large-scale studies to establish its full benefits are lacking. Despite this, some over-the-counter products include activated charcoal, capitalizing on its chemical properties.\n\nHere are some potential uses of activated charcoal, with varying scientific support:\n\n1. Kidney Health: It may help the kidneys by clearing out toxins, particularly those related to urea. Some [studies on animals suggest that it could improve kidney function and reduce inflammation in chronic kidney disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691513008600?via%3Dihub).\n2. Intestinal Gas: Activated charcoal might alleviate intestinal gas by trapping gas-causing substances. Some studies have found it may improve symptoms seen on ultrasound examinations of abdominal organs.\n3. Diarrhea: As an absorbent, activated charcoal might trap bacteria and diarrhea-causing substances, making it a potential treatment option. It appears to have fewer side effects compared to traditional medications for diarrhea.\n4. Teeth Whitening and Oral Health: Despite its presence in many whitening products, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of activated charcoal for teeth whitening or oral health.\n5. Skin Care: Activated charcoal may help remove skin impurities, making it easier to cleanse the skin.\n6. Deodorant: Its potential to absorb odors and moisture makes activated charcoal a candidate for underarm deodorants, as well as for use in shoes and refrigerators.\n7. Skin Infections: Traditionally, activated charcoal has been used to treat skin infections, with some evidence suggesting it can absorb harmful bacteria from wounds.\n\nMedical applications include its use in emergency rooms to manage overdoses or poisonings, by binding to various substances to prevent their absorption. However, it doesn\u2019t work for all types of toxins, and its effectiveness is time-sensitive, often within 1 to 4 hours of ingestion. It\u2019s crucial to seek professional medical help rather than attempting home treatment for serious poisonings or overdoses.\n\n## Membrane Filtration:\n\nReverse osmosis (RO) membranes are critical components in the desalination and purification of water. The selection of a specific type of RO membrane depends on the application, water source, and desired outcome. Here are the primary types of RO membranes:\n\n* Cellulose Triacetate (CTA) Membrane:\n   * Made from cellulose and is chlorine-tolerant.\n   * More prone to bacterial fouling.\n   * Typically rejects around 93% of common contaminants.\n* Thin Film Composite (TFC) or Thin Film Material (TFM) Membrane:\n   * Constructed from synthetic material, commonly polyamide.\n   * More efficient with a rejection rate of around 98% of typical contaminants.\n   * Highly sensitive to chlorine, requiring carbon pre-filters for chlorinated water sources.\n   * Generally offers better flow rates and lasts longer than CTA membranes.\n* Hollow Fiber (HF) Membrane:\n   * Comprises tiny tubes or fiber strands.\n   * Water flows either inside the tubes and exits around the outside (inside-out) or vice versa (outside-in).\n   * Less commonly used for RO but more prevalent in ultrafiltration.\n* Plate and Frame Membrane:\n   * Comprises flat sheets of membrane material held between a series of frames and plates.\n   * Less commonly used due to its bulky nature, but it can be efficient for specific applications.\n* Spiral Wound Membrane:\n   * Made by wrapping flat sheets of membrane material around a central tube in a spiral fashion.\n   * Most common design for commercial and industrial RO systems due to its compactness and high surface area.\n* Tubular Membrane:\n   * Tube-like and allows feed water to pass through the interior of the tubes.\n   * Less prone to fouling, making them suitable for waters with high suspended solids.\n* Brackish Water Membranes:\n   * Designed for water sources with low to medium salinity, such as groundwater and surface water.\n* Seawater Membranes:\n   * Specifically designed to treat high salinity waters like seawater. They are built to withstand challenging conditions and high pressures of desalination processes.\n* Low Energy/ Low Pressure Membranes:\n   * Developed to operate at lower pressures, making them more energy-efficient. Suitable for lightly contaminated water sources.\n* High Rejection Membranes:\n* Designed to reject a high percentage of contaminants, ideal for applications that require very pure water.\n\nThe choice of membrane type largely depends on the water source, the contaminants present, the desired quality of the treated water, and the specific application of the RO system.\n\n* Material: Most modern RO membranes are made of Thin Film Composite (TFC) because of their superior contaminant rejection and durability.\n* Flushing: Periodic flushing of the membrane can extend its life by preventing scaling and fouling.\n\n## Permeate Pump (Optional):\n\n* Type: Typically non-electric and powered by the hydraulic energy of the reject water to inject permeate water into a pressure tank, reducing overall power consumption of the RO system.\n* Efficiency: It can recover an average of 80% more water while reducing wastage and increasing membrane lifespan.\n\n## Enhanced Membrane Performance for Superior Water Quality\n\nThe Permeate Pump in Reverse Osmosis systems mitigates the decrease in membrane efficiency caused by back pressure from the storage tank. Creating a separation between the tank's back pressure and the household water supply ensures consistent high pressure across the RO membrane, leading to optimal TDS reduction, improved water quality, and prolonged membrane lifespan.\n\n## Faster Tank Refill Rates\n\nA Reverse Osmosis system equipped with a Permeate Pump can refill its pressurized storage tank up to 50% faster than standard RO systems. The pump counteracts the typical slowdown in water production that occurs as tank pressure increases, allowing a membrane rated at 50 gallons per day to produce nearly 75 gallons.\n\n## Significantly Reduced Wastewater and Enhanced System Longevity\n\nIncorporating a Permeate Pump into a Reverse Osmosis system not only conserves water by reducing waste by up to 80% but also promotes the longevity of the system's components. This eco-friendly, non-electric solution minimizes the volume of water processed, resulting in less wear and a greener operation overall.\n\n## Remineralization (Optional):\n\n* Materials: Typically uses calcite or a blend of calcite and corosex to add calcium and magnesium back into the water.\n* Balance: Ensures pH balance, preventing potential leaching from plumbing.\n\n## Storage Tank For Permeate Water:\n\n* Bladder: Inside, a food-grade bladder keeps the water pressurized. Over time, this bladder can lose its elasticity and might need replacement.\n* Sanitization: Regular sanitization prevents microbial growth inside the tank.\n\n## Storage Tank Reject Water (Optional):\n\n* Salinity: The reject water has a high salt concentration, which might make it unsuitable for certain applications like plant watering or washing machines.\n* Recycling: Great for reject-water-powered toilet flushing, aiming to use this in a holistically sustainable home, minimizing wastage.\n\n[An IBC Tank is a great option for brine water storage.](https://unimother.de/blogs/household/ibc-tote-rain-collection-a-sustainable-choice-for-your-family) To save money, buy second-hand from your local area.\n\n## Potable Pump for Stored Water (Optional):\n\n* Types: Can be diaphragm-based or have a small electric pump, depending on the system.\n* Energy Consumption: While it does use energy, it ensures consistent flow rates from the storage tank.\n\n## Activated Carbon Post Filter (Optional):\n\n* Function: Also referred to as \"polishing\" filters, they ensure any residual tastes or compounds are removed.\n* Replacement: Given their position as the last line of defense, regular checks and timely replacements are crucial.\n\n## UV light Post Treatment (Optional):\n\n* Spectrum: Operates at the 254 nm wavelength, lethal to microbes.\n* Quartz Sleeve: The UV bulb is encased in a quartz sleeve to keep it from making contact with water, which must be cleaned periodically to ensure effective UV transmission.\n\nEach component's specifics can vary based on the manufacturer and the specific needs of the installation. Regular maintenance and periodic checks ensure optimal performance and longevity of the system.\n\nOsmosis technology efficiently purifies tap, well, and rainwater using regular household water pressure. It demands a higher pressure when overcoming the osmotic pressure of water with high minerals, mainly calcium, in your source water.\n\nUsing a simple osmosis water filter gives lots of health benefits, like more intelligence and strength.\n\nOsmosis filter provides mineral-free water, which can be beneficial for controlling what minerals you want to consume in your diet and how much water you want to drink. It removes most chemicals, heavy metals, and drugs present in tap and bottled water, avoiding plastic leaches and microplastics that cause cancer, a variety of diseases, weakness, constant pain, and even addictions.\n\nFor greater sustainability, reuse wastewater for non-potable purposes like flushing toilets or cleaning. Remineralizing the filtered water restores essential minerals for extra health benefits. You can also consume the minerals directly, which is the preferred approach because you have more control over what minerals you consume. Investing in a simple osmosis water filter is excellent for personal health and sustainability! Plus, it saves you lots of money, time, and water carrying in the long term. You also have to visit the doctor less often, which can be a lot of money.\n\n## Reverse Osmosis Filter vs Other Membrane Filtration Methods\n\nMembrane Filtration is a technique used to separate or remove particles from a liquid using a semipermeable membrane. The water entering this process is known as the 'Feed Stream', while the liquid that passes through the membrane is called the 'Permeate'. The remaining liquid with retained particles is termed the 'Retentate'.\n\n## Microfiltration and Ultrafiltration\n\nMicrofiltration (MF) primarily focuses on removing larger particles and is often used as a pretreatment for other filtration methods. Ultrafiltration (UF) operates at a level between MF and NF, targeting smaller particles and larger molecules, making it suitable for applications like protein separation and virus removal.\n\n## Reverse Osmosis and Nanofiltration\n\nTwo primary types of Membrane Filtration used for drinking water are Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Nanofiltration (NF). Though they appear similar and both operate based on hydraulic pressure, they have distinct differences:\n\n## Reverse Osmosis (RO) vs. Nanofiltration (NF):\n\n* **Functionality**: RO is designed to filter out even the smallest solute molecules like salt, making it preferred for applications requiring complete purification. NF, on the other hand, is designed to retain beneficial nutrients and is more efficient in removing hardness-causing ions and most contaminants from water.\n* **Applications**: RO is widely used in industries ranging from desalination to wastewater treatment in sectors like petrochemical, food processing, and municipal wastewater. NF is gaining attention for water softening and removing contaminants from drinking water. It's also efficient for treating wastewater for reuse purposes.\n* **Operating Principle**: While both processes use pressure, NF operates at lower pressures than RO. RO provides a higher level of purification but at the cost of higher energy consumption. NF, being a looser version of RO, requires less energy.\n\nIn conclusion, while both RO and NF are membrane filtration processes, they serve different purposes based on their filtration capabilities and energy requirements. RO is ideal for absolute water purification, whereas NF is better suited for tasks that don't need the complete removal of dissolved solids but require less energy.\n\n## Osmosis Filter Systems Maintenance Check\n\nReverse osmosis (RO) systems are powerful, but their filters don't last indefinitely. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure you're drinking pure RO water. An RO system typically has three or four stages: sediment pre-filter, carbon pre-filter, the RO membrane, and an optional carbon post-filter for stored water. Each filter needs periodic replacement, with frequency depending on your water consumption.\n\n## RO Filter Lifespan\n\nFor instance, larger households may need to change filters more frequently. The RO membrane usually lasts between two and five years. However, other filters may need replacement every six months to a year, depending on your local water quality. It's advisable to change the sediment filter and carbon pre-filter at least annually, but the amount of household water usage can affect this timeline. The carbon post-filter will last longer, normally 1 to 2 years, and you can notice it\u2019s time when the water changes its taste.\n\nTo increase the RO membrane's life span, **flush your system for 2 - 5 minutes after usage**.\n\n## Indicators Of Filter Replacement Need\n\nEven though there are no signs to know that the carbon or sediment filter is saturated, the RO membrane will still filter out the contaminants, but over short or long, the membrane will either block or get damaged. So, keep track of when you must change the pre-filters in your calendar.\n\nIf you're uncertain about filter replacement, here are some signs:\n\n1. Water Pressure: Reduced water pressure indicates a filter change is overdue. While RO faucets won't have extremely high pressure, the flow should still be consistent.\n2. Taste: RO water filters out contaminants, giving it a distinct taste free from metals, minerals, and chlorine. If you detect a chlorine or mineral taste, it's time to replace the carbon and RO membrane filters. Aim for an annual replacement to maintain optimal water quality.\n3. Water Test: A simple aquarium water test strip can show you when to change the membrane. There is also a TDS(=Total Dissolved Solids) Meter to test the permeate water. When you see an increase in hardness or any other water parameters tested, you know it\u2019s time to replace your filter.\n\n**Be the force behind clean water for all!**\n\n## Health Benefits of Using Osmosis Water Filters: Clean Water and Its Impacts.\n\nUsing Osmosis Water Filters offers many health benefits. It filters out impurities and contaminants, eliminating harmful substances and preventing adverse health effects from contaminated tap and bottled water. Moreover, osmosis water filters prevent the formation of kidney stones, cancer, and preterm birth and increase the IQ and strength of you and your children. This is because they remove calcium deposits, heavy metals, and many chemical pollutants currently in our environment. In addition, they provide clean and mineral-free water to promote better overall health and sustainability.\n\nFor a long time, people believed that tap or bottled water was enough to stay hydrated and get all essential minerals. However, it was later found that these waters lack most of the 13 minerals required for optimal mineralization. Plus, it helps our body get sufficient hydration, and we can add minerals with food and supplements as required. Therefore, we don\u2019t have to rely on \u201cminerals\u201d(=calcium) from tap or mineral water, which lacks many minerals and has a worse water quality than most tap waters while costing 1000 times more and being very environmentally damaging.\n\nOsmosis water filters offer clean and contamination-free water for improved health while being cheaper and environmentally friendly.

", "The Next 2187 Years Based on [The Next Ten Billion Years](https://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html) by Ugo Bardi and inspired by the thread [How Do You Imagine The Year 2067](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uu0oup/how_do_you_imagine_the_year_2067/) by u/hwlpimconfusion, here's my (quick) take on the matter. And of course, I'm a random guy posting on a subreddit dedicated to the end of the world, so naturally I'm 100% precise and 100% accurate on this, but I'd still love to hear your takes. (Especially because of how US-centric this is.)\n\n**3 Years**\n\nPresident Ron DeSantis defeated Kamela Harris is the US Presidential election; elsewhere, numerous 'nonstandard' candidates have been taking seats left and right. Protests were muted because DeSantis very clearly won both the electoral and popular votes, embracing the Trump but actually running on 'Inflation is bad, m'kay.\" (Biden elected not to run, while Trump didn't survive *to* the primary.)\n\nSpeaking of, supply chain issues and shortages- especially of fuel- are still rampant. The end of the Russo-Ukrainian War certainly helped the issue, but both countries are in ruins- as are a lot of others (because surprise surprise, creating a food shortage in the middle of a monetary and fuel shock is not conducive to global stability.) This had led to difficulties in most parts of global supply chains. The fuel situation especially has not improved- OPEC+ production has technically decreased due to Russia cutting back production, and American shale hasn't reached pre-pandemic highs. Europe has also begun fracking exploration in Poland, Germany and France using newer detection, drilling and lateral designs.\n\nThe impact of disease still can't be ignored, of course; new COVID variants, plus a few other scares (monkeypox being the biggest) kept things snarled up nicely. However, COVID is now basically akin to the cold.\n\nLake Mead and/or Lake Powell are dead pool this year, introducing power shortages and water shortages to the western US.\n\nThe economy is still weak. Banks didn't quite fail this time, but internet companies did, with even industry giants such as Amazon needing a bailout. A second real estate bubble also popped, most fracking companies nearly died (kept alive only by sky-high oil prices), and the QE and 2020 stim checks meant that the methods which propped the economy back up after '08 couldn't be done this time. Still, economists are still baffled as to why this is taking so long...\n\n**9 Years**\n\nThe US has faced at least one severely-contested election; declining prosperity has made the alternate parties more intractable. President DeSantis turned out to have little real power for solving problems; the closest he came were experiments in price fixing (like Nixon did), and those had broadly the same results.\n\nSupply chains worldwide have been somewhat repaired. Some was due to better integrating pandemic protocols into trading hubs and workplaces. A lot of this, however, is due to the abandonment of just-in-time delivery. Others are from the abandonment of projects; weather disasters are also causing annual delays. Food production never quite reached pre-pandemic highs, but has mostly recovered (in quantity at least.)\n\nUkraine is still physically devastated from the war. Russia's economy is still weakened by the war. China's economy only recently recovered from the zero-COVID policy.\n\nOn the plus side, no one trusts planned obsolescence anymore- even clothes are made tougher now. On the minus, everything's more expensive, and the materials are worse, so those tougher things are more likely to be defective. Thankfully, the most repaired chains are for commodities- lithium, copper, and iron plateaued during the decade, while cobalt, lithium, platinum, silver, nickel, and others actually decreased due to shallow-sea and deep-sea mining plus new deposits from renewed exploration.\n\nThere's been at least one new plague by this point, most likely avian flu. Despite this, the world population has exceeded 8 billion.\n\nThe California Dream is dead. Their water allocation was severely cut, their precipitation decreased drastically, and the central valley completely drained their own groundwater. This has wreaked havoc on US food production. Heat, economic crisis and wildfire have wreaked havoc on their electrical system; parts of LA faced blackouts lasting months, and and the California Forestry and Fire Control Board have authorized the California Fire Control Company, which harvests the unburned ecosystems to sell as fuel biomass for the power plants- often the ones replacing the dry hydro stations.\n\nWorse, this drought extends throughout the west, and farmers are beginning to experience problems with the Ogallala...\n\nOil and gas production is declining from all formations within the United States except the Marcellus Shale. In the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, plus two of the three Permian formations, drilling for new oil has also stopped. Interest in Alaskan shale is modest, but light tight oil has poor quality and no pipelines exist to bring the natural gas to US markets. The President does plan to approve the Alaska-Canada Pipeline along with oil exploration in ANWR once the political crises in both countries are resolved. Also planned is a 5 GW geothermal station in Yellowstone.\n\nEfficient and long-lasting battery storage, more-efficient green hydrogen, larger and longer-lasting offshore turbines, and 27%-efficient PV cells are on the market- so long as anyone can afford to buy them. The wealthy are still well-to-do, but even the jet-setters are forced to see that something is wrong- if nothing else than because of how expensive running a private jet these days is.\n\nComputers and cell phones are still generally available, often with genuinely-incredible new under-the-hood features, but the Internet is much simpler than it was at its peak. DNS servers and the like cost money to run, and with the L-shaped recovery, advertising stopped paying the bills. Many formerly-free services are now subscription-only, while others (such as YouTube) now delete videos based on an algorithm.\n\nChina and the US both have plans for a Moon base. Both plans are delayed temporarily. Ongoing are plans to create GMO crops and GMO animals- among them cold-hardy elephants to replace mammoths in the far north (to aid in carbon sequestration).\n\n**27 years**\n\nThe US still exists, but the two political parties have either disintegrated or drastically reformed; the US itself has experienced at least one true insurrection, one constitutional crisis, and has passed at least one Amendment. Much power has also been devolved to the States.\n\nClimate change has heavily destabilized multiple world governments, especially by producing famine and by directly creating unsurvivable heat.  As a result, global trade is significantly hampered. New sailing ships tend to be more efficient in the water, but also come in several new varieties (in order of price-based utility):\n\n* gas-turbine, burning light tight oil or natural gas\n* PV motors and wind-catching kites\n* micronuclear\n\nWorld population is below 8 billion and falling fast. Wealth is way down, food production per capita is down, health is down.  The rise in sea level combined with severe storms  has damaged some port facilities, but the construction of floating buildings (so long as they're well-made) has alleviated this somewhat.\n\nThe banking system has disintegrated. Some of their fundamentals were that spending money was a good way to make money; however, as the economy faltered and then shrank, it became a good way to lose money- or, as inflation skyrocketed and people began putting money into *things*, wealth. Nowadays, banking and investing is essentially all local- even for large and important projects, governments have difficulty in financing. \n\nMany fisheries worldwide have collapsed, but the breeding and release of captive animals has ensured that most ecosystems will at least have the capacity to recover. Ironically enough, the increasing failure of industrial agriculture and industry has begun to allow for fisheries to recover; additionally, where governments are at least partially stable, aquaculture is both more sustainable and growing.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is now consistently ice-free in summer. The Greenland Ice Sheet has begun retreating significantly and may be developing meltwater lakes.\n\nThere has been at least one disease as transmissible as COVID and as serious as SARS. Additionally, antibacterial/antiparasitical/antifungal/antiviral resistance is commonplace. Regular disease is taking an increasing toll, although low-tech methods of healthcare are still keeping their toll lower than they would have been.\n\nThe entire western US is depopulating fast. They have between a quarter and a third of the surface water they had available 27 years ago, plus none from the dams or groundwater. California had a population below 10 million as of the last census, nine years ago, and the rest of the west- away from the coast- is worse off. The Ogallala is on its last legs and with its depletion came another unpleasant discovery- that the transpiration from the crops in the high plains has been mitigating drought further east.\n\nYellowstone Geothermal Station was never completed- heavy public opposition and cost overruns combined with declining Western demand for electricity; the little power it produces now mostly supports the kerogen liquefaction industry to the south and the logging industry in the former park itself. Some interest exists in building a high-voltage line east, but the project is generally considered too expensive.\n\nThe Alaska-Canada Pipeline was never completed either, but this is more generally considered a good thing- the Alaska Dream is growing up, and with it comes plenty of nearly-untouched natural gas. Alaska, of course, is for the manufacturing; the Northwest Territories and Greenland are for the mining.\n\nSpeaking of, oil production. Peak production for oil was in 2019; since then, the price of extraction and trade has kept it from making a comeback. Global production has been falling in an extended stepwise pattern; in the US, it far more resembled a butte. Gas production was similar- where possible, coal or wood gasifiers have by now been added generating stations. Experiments with *in situ* coal gasification in the US are ongoing.\n\nMore gas comes from Mexico- the Eagle Ford and Permian basins crossed the border and the Chicontepec was massive, but weren't tapped for cost reasons. As American oil and gas production collapsed, the Mexican government- in exchange for very high prices and military assistance for dealing with the cartels- agreed to sell oil and gas to the US. (As a side note- after the theft of both batteries and panels, some bases use radiothermal generators for power.) Despite this, parts of the US still have unreliable electricity.\n\nThe US population is now 360 million and rising despite the low birthrate. The main methods of transportation are trains, public, and motorcycles; electric cars never achieved market penetration and diesel is now a carefully rationed fuel. The airline industry is effectively dead. At least 10% of the US population is directly involved with agriculture. 'Victory Gardens' are common, especially in the suburbs- housing is in too short a supply to destroy them, but they're too far from the cities and have too small yards to truly make good market gardens. Bulk food is now heavily local; the long-range transport still exists, but is very expensive and many of the original sources no longer exist.\n\nSolar PV and wind finally make up a substantial share of US electricity generation. While solar panels and grid-scale batteries are maintaining their stability, however, manufacturing and repairing wind turbines has become difficult. As they have a lifespan of 25 years (sometimes as short as 15 due to manufacturing defects), their contribution to the grid is likely to begin declining- especially since so many are located in desert areas.\n\nThe Internet is now partially divided into separate intranets, albeit connected by a paywalled internet. Despite the difficulty in manufacturing chips, it's still generally easier (and more efficient in energy and material) to use computers and wired intranets for local news and services than it is for regular television or radio broadcasting. What this entails differs by locale- a small or poor one may only have a local news site with podcast, basic wikipedia, basic banking, and shut off between the hours of midnight and 9 AM, while a major one may have a YouTube-like or Netflix-like 24-hour streaming service and video game servers.\n\nConcepts such as 'ecological overshoot' and 'ERoI' are now common knowledge, as is the idea of a collapse of civilization. The US is demonstrably poorer and suffering the ravages of climate change; many things once taken for granted, such as ubiquitous cars, Hollywood blockbusters, and the city of New Orleans, no longer exist. There are strong echoes of melancholy and nihlism in parts of American society; nativism is an ongoing problem.\n\nBefore the collapse of Hollywood (financial mostly, especially since water crises and heat waves made LA difficult), even they were getting in on the act (along with 2010s and 2020s nostalgia), making television shows such as *Worm* and movies like *A Matter for Men.* Lower-budget productions are still made, often capitalizing on collective nostalgia and similar themes, such as the show *RE: Trailer Trash* and the movie *Star's Reach.*\n\nThe US is shifting its priorities towards low-tech solutions; they are currently experimenting with zebra and camel cavalry along with horses in Alaska, although these aren't expected to be combat-ready for at least a decade. The Moon base is indefinitely cancelled, as is astronomical research.\n\n**81 Years**\n\nThe US and Canada experienced at least one civil war or agreed dissolusion, and may be a rump state (if it wasn't by 27 years.) People are more impoverished than they were at the 27-year mark; the 'elites' who had maintained their wealth have lost it by now, unless they act as feudal landlords. Most ideas of 'civil duty' are applied very locally, though they're stronger than they were in 2022- or in 2049.\n\nAlmost all fossil fuels in North America have been extracted; plenty of industries have been electrified, but keeping PV panels, wind turbines and nuclear reactors safe has been difficult. The ideal power source is now a radiothermal generator with isotopes generated by nuclear waste; their output is small but constant over years.\n\nCO2 concentrations of at least 500 PPM here has been at least one meltwater pulse from Antarctica and Greenland, both suddenly and severely raising sea levels and wreaking climatic havoc. In North America, this translated into a temporary return to 20th-century climatic norms, destroying crops (especially fruit trees) and causing famines.\n\nSea level rise has forced the partial abandonment of most coastal cities; in the US, this includes moving the US capital.\n\nPandemics are more common, but diseases are beginning to lose their resistance to common antibiotics- they survive worse than their normal counterparts.\n\nMany places in CONUS have no access to electricity, radio or computing; the far north of the continent generally has access to all three, due to abundant hydropower, solar in the summer, wind in the winter. This is strongly aided by the collection of helium from the natural gas, although running short is beginning to be an issue. Malware, equipment production and power concerns have ensured that that the Internet no longer exists; multiple intranets exist, often relying on homemade protocols, but their capabilities and natures vary wildly. In some areas, these are little more than BBS systems.\n\nRoad and rail systems, while a part of the public good, are as subject to destruction as PV/wind farms and manufacturing centers.\n\n**243 Years**\n\nThe rapidly-changing climate has created chaotic migrations that, while not completely destroying the idea of America, have completely destroyed the American identity- it's seen as more akin to Rome than anything else. Repeated meltwater pulses, slower ongoing sea-level rise, and violent ocean storms have ensured that oceanic trade is minimal.\n\nMost agriculture is based on permaculture, mostly because that's the only agriculture that's sustainable in an era of initially-poor (Alaska) or degraded (CONUS) soils and non-existent climate that also works with minimal inputs. In Alaska, these are often partially industrialized; in CONUS, the various city-states are often primitive (though not always) to the point of having a 19th-century level of technology. Even Alaska, though, tends to use horsepower.\n\nAir travel is once again taking off- PV blimps and dirigibles with a hydrogen lifting gas are nearly perfectly sustainable. These have enabled intercontinental travel and limited trade.\n\nThe decentralized nature of manufacturing, even for things like some types of PV panels, have strongly limited centralization and trade.\n\nWorldwide production of fossil fuels has mostly ended.\n\n**729 Years**\n\nPolities and ethnicities have finally stabilized. New languages have been born. Amidst the petty wars of small empires and city-states, a few have begun remembering the time when the continent was mostly united.\n\nCO2 concentrations have leveled off at least at 550 ppm. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is retreating, but the climate and sea level rise have both mostly stabilized.\n\n**2187 Years**\n\nThe American Confederation, made in the image of the old states but distinct from (and longer-lasting than) them, is facing serious problems of its own. Founded in an era of climate stability and fresh resources in the far north, their political systems- unifying disparate cultural groups from Alaska to Mexico and east to the Atlantic, have ossified and become entrenched. Meanwhile, the decline of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is accelerating, destroying the sea trade that helped make the Confederation so successful, while meltwater pulses are once again wreaking havoc with the climate.\n\nWorse, they've exceeded their overall carrying capacity, with a total population of 150 million and an environment that still hasn't completely stabilized from the climate bands moving north.\n\nHistory repeats.", "Ammunition is way too scarce in CDDA Alright, time to put the nail in the coffin of the often-repeated trope of \"ammunition would be scarce during an apocalyptic scenario\". \n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, reading the \"TL;DR\" and general recommendations sections should be sufficient unless you want to take a look at the supporting evidence and calculations. God this was depressing to research, TW I guess unless you're a Doomer.\n\n\nTL;DR:  ammo is too scarce, I'd recommend quadrupling ammunition available in-game at a minimum, supporting evidence is after my general recommendations, with sources at the bottom\n\n\nJust the US Military alone has an estimated 7.5 million tons of small arms ammunition, which equates to approximately 701 billion rounds of 5.56 ammunition(using 5.56 as example). Utilizing the rate of ammunition expenditure in Afganistan per insurgent killed of 250,000, exhausting just 75% of this stockpile in domestic conflict (525 billion) would result in the deaths of 2 million Americans and the wounding of 6 million others. This excludes the possibility for massive collateral casualties within America's numerous urban environments, the production of on average 2 Billion rounds of ammunition for the government, as well as the incomprehensible damage a conflict of this scale would have on American society without even considering the impacts of the blob, zombies, and the portal storms before the end of the world.\n\n\nThe horrifying reality is that the population of the Earth possesses such an unbelievably large stockpile of conventional small arms weaponry and ammunition (Comparable to the world's nuclear stockpile and our resulting MAD in the event of their full utilization ever), that if unleashed to the extent necessary to justify the scarcity of ammunition in CDDA it would result in the end of the world regardless of the portal storms, the blob's invasion, and the presence of zombies. Considering that military-grade ammunition can remain usable over 50 years after its date of production(Small Arms Survey 2005 Chp 01 pg 17,) it is probable that in an apocalyptic scenario (like the one seen in CDDA) ammunition would remain plentiful for years after all the remaining reserves of food had been consumed or rotted away.\n\n\nGeneral recommendations:\n\n\nAmmunition is way too scarce in CDDA at the moment and this scarcity has a significant negative impact on the ability to balance the use and effectiveness of firearms. Currently, the only method in place to balance how highly effective firearms are in CDDA is through the scarcity of ammunition. This leads to scenarios where upon killing any turret as a player ammunition becomes a non-concern and their 5.56, 7.62, and .50 weaponry become effectively an \"I win button\" unless they play recklessly. Furthermore, how highly effective conventional 21st-century firearms are against the interdimensional threats in-game has significant lore consequences for the Exodii and other Human factions. If these factions could wield firearms as effectively as the player does against these threats in-game the tension of their struggle for survival is erased.\n\n\nAnother consideration is that by having the primary balancing mechanism for firearms be the scarcity of their ammunition, novel and alternative methods of balance for contributors to develop are suppressed. For example, considering the Exodii's constant struggle against the blob highly evolved zombies should be highly resistant to conventional gunfire. This creates a space for prototype Rivtech weaponry (which is currently used mostly for the cool factor) and futuristic Exodii weaponry to be some of the few ways that players can effectively defeat highly evolved zombies.\n\n\nA further mechanism for balancing firearms beyond scarcity is by introducing a similar damage type system for ranged weaponry as we currently have for melee. With hollow-point being analogous to cutting, full-metal jacket to piercing, and armor-piercing to blunt in increasing order of efficiency against armor (however, even the lowly soldier zombie's ESAPI armor would stop most AP rounds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5Mi9wtAUg). Considering that the purchasing of armor-piercing ammunition is illegal in many jurisdictions and is thus very scarce in the hands of civilian gun owners, this would provide an organic incentive for players to raid military (which are already planned to be rarer) and police armories to effectively use firearms against evolved enemies. Also, the most advanced Exodii and Rivtech weapons/ammo could be made the only real effective ranged damage against the most highly evolved of enemies while being scarce enough that they cannot be used indiscriminately(which creates another incentive for players to develop a strong relationship with the Exodii similar to the CBM changes). This change would tie in very well to the oncoming addition of organ damage. While HP ammo would deal moderate damage regardless of where it hit on the target's body, FMJ and especially AP would both be very dependent on the landing center of mass hits. This could also lead to novel gameplay situations such as a player preferring to target the limbs of a zombie when their JHP or HP ammo cannot penetrate their armor.\n\n\nThis differentiation of damage types would also resolve a frequent criticism of the current bow implementation (which I think is well done) that bows are ineffective unless they are of the highest tier. Barbed arrows could have high alpha damage but a low armor-piercing ability which would make them good against fleshly targets but horrible against armored, broadhead would be an effective midground between damage and piercing, and thin/long \"armor-piercing\" arrows would be moderately effective against certain armored zombies but low on overall damage. \n\n\nFurthermore, once the world bubble system is expanded and the sound mechanics/zombie pathing refined indiscriminate firing of small arms in cities (enabled by abundant ammunition) would become a death sentence as hordes of evolved and small arms resistant zombies would descend on their position if they did so. Even with silencers, most modern weaponry is not silent, suppressors mainly reduce the sound created by escaping gases (allowing the shooter to forgo ear protection if they desire) while doing nothing to reduce the supersonic \"crack\" created by the travel of the bullet. Weapons that use a combination of subsonic ammunition and suppressors to create very quiet firearms are rare (with the Russian AS-VAL's 9x39mm and Belgian FN FiveseveN's 5.7x38mm being 2 examples). With this in mind players who need a common silent ranged option would organically gravitate towards bows as an alternative.\n\n\nThe final option I thought of is making ammunition and weaponry equipped by zombies damaged and filthy in the same way their clothing is. Firearms when exposed to dust and mud (analogous to the black ooze that zombies are covered in and produce) suffer from frequent jams and malfunctions which require a full disassembly and deep-cleaning to remediate (Inrangetv has an entire series on firearms exposed to dust and mud https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNw179rHxkQ&list=PLj9u4Ts2NpEv4Fnwx2_ig4wVqiONfH1me&index=23). A novice who is lacking both the experience and a manual would find it difficult to do so without losing parts, reassembling the gun wrong, or damaging the internals of the gun. Further, if the ooze leaking from zombies were made mildly corrosive over extended periods of time some of the damage could be made irreparable. These corroded rounds would be more prone to misfires with the only salvageable parts left being the smokeless powder inside and possibly the primer. This change would also tie nicely into the idea of \"firearm ferals\" that has been proposed. With the changes above firearm ferals would only be able to fire off a few rounds before the gun was rendered inoperable by the filth and corrosion\n\n\nAll of the above are solely meant to be examples of the varying options that contributors could use as balancing mechanisms for firearms, not requests for their implementation. Further, by embracing the abundance of ammunition (as well as the niche situations that they would be useful and making the acquiring/use of different types of ammunition necessary) that there would be in the post-Cataclysm era the use of firearms would no longer be such a binary affair (either no ammo or all the ammo and the ability to kill all enemy types) but instead would be a much more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience defined by trade-offs and player decision making.\n\n\n\nSupporting evidence (oh boy math time):\n\n\n\nThe US military has an estimated stockpile of 34,000,000 tons of munitions (Pg 93 Small Arms Survey 2008 Chp 3)\n22% of which are small arms ammunition, or 7,480,000 tons. \nassuming that every round is 5.56, there are 93,750 5.56 per ton(Pg 11 Small Arms Survey 2005 chp 1)\nwhich equates to 701,250,000,000 rounds of 5.56\nLet's assume that the current in-game level of ammo represents 25% of this stockpile, that would mean 525,937,500,000 rounds of 5.56 were expended during Cataclysm and events preceding it\n\n\nTaking deaths from Covid 19 as a comparison for a massively destabilizing amount of death over the course of more than a year (609,012) would equate to 863,591 rounds spent per death(all of this discounts the existence of the 3-1[Small Arms Survey 2012 Chp 3] ratio between injuries and fatalities in conflicts), compared to the estimated 250,000 rounds of ammunition spent for every kill in Afghanistan(Global Security 2005).\n\n\nAssuming that the same ammunition expenditure ratio per death (not total casualties as discussed earlier) would hold true for a major intranational conflict within the United States of 250,000, that would equate to 2,103,750 people dead and 6,311,250 wounded to expend 75% of the US military's ammunition reserves.\n\n\nThe kind of ammunition expenditure that would justify the incredibly scarce (outside of turrets) military-grade ammunition available in CDDA would require a conflict of equivalent intensity to the one seen in  Afganistan but extended over the entire continental United States for potentially a decade. Furthermore, with the current canonical start of the game born in mind, (Generously we'll assume that the blob's first manifestations a year before the Cataclysm/portal storms would result in such intense conflict and thus ammunition expenditure over a period of a year) we would have to believe that the US army of about 2 million including reservists and internationally deployed units would expend 525 billion rounds of ammunition in a year.\n\n\nThat would mean that each soldier deployed in the US would be individually responsible for firing 262,968.75 rounds of ammunition and having killed on average 1 citizen and injured 3 others within the span of a year (discounting that intense conflict within the canon only occurs within the last couple of months). Which would be the equivalent of each soldier firing an m249 (at a sustained rate of 100 rounds per minute) for nearly 2 days straight.\n\n\nAll of this theorizing is without including the logistical nightmare sustaining this kind of conflict would require(Small Arms Ammunition Production and Acquisition Strategy for the US Army 1995 for more info)(Operation Patriot Bandoleer as well), discounting the other 78% of the US's conventional ammunition stockpile (missiles, tank/artillery shells, mines, grenades, etc), the theoretical number of casualties the US military would sustain during such intense conflict, the US's annual production of about 2 billion rounds of ammunition, stray bullets killing unbelievable amounts of non-combatants in the close urban environments of America (Small Arms Survey 2012 Chp 3 Pg 86), as well as assuming that the American military's 2,000,000 soldiers would be entirely composed of mechanized, motorized, and foot infantry. All of this is also without considering that the other branches of the US military the Navy and Air-force's constitute a significant portion of that total number of enlisted individuals and would be engaged in their own efforts to suppress the civil disturbance caused by the conflict (with their corresponding massive expenditure of even more weapons of death) and the resulting instability caused by that activity.\n\n\nConsidering that the global average violent deaths per year is  526,000, of which only 10% are from direct conflict (52,600), that would mean that the death of 2 million Americans within the span of about a year from direct conflict would constitute a 4,000% increase in the global violent deaths for the year by conflict the United States alone. Furthermore, the most deadly war America has been involved in, the civil war(when considering both the Union and Confederate deaths together), only had an average amount dead of 99,502.2 per year which would make the year of the Cataclysm have 2,000% more violent deaths per year than the deadliest year in US history(in absolute terms, not per capita).\n\n\nThe US military is well aware that they have too much ammunition for a post-cold war era military. They spend a significant amount of resources destroying ammunition. They burn it, bury it, disassemble it, export it, etc and even with all that expenditure and effort, it is estimated that the rate of production/accumulation of small arms and ammunition continues to outstrip their destruction within the US and the rest of the globe(Small Arms Survey 2008 Chp3 pgs 94-99). \n\n\nThe civilian population of the US is in possession of nearly 400 million firearms(Small Arms Survey Estimating Global-Civilian Held Firearms Numbers 2018) and 9 billion rounds of ammunition (The Firearm Industry Trade Association 2019) are produced for civilian markets within the US every year. It is estimated that the US military has a stockpile of 3 million small arms(Small Arms Survey 2008 Chp3 pg 87), giving the possession of civilian small arms to military a ratio of 133 to 1 within the US, which is significantly higher than the global average of 6.5 civilian firearms to every 1 possessed by a military (857 million civilian to 133 million military). Furthermore, for everyone round of ammunition produced for the US military, 4.5 are produced for civilian consumption(9 billion civilian to 2 billion military). \n\n\nThe statistics on civilian ownership of ammunition is unknown, however, we can look at recent purchases of other small arms (which we do have the statistics for) to find an approximation. Vanderbink's (Vista Outdoor's President of Ammunition) conservative estimate is that 100 rounds of ammunition are acquired by each new gun owner (American Rifleman). Extrapolating off this number and the over 400 million firearms in the US, we can calculate that on the low end the 72 million US gun owners are in possession of 40 billion rounds of ammunition, giving the average gun owner possession about 500 rounds of ammunition. \n\n\nWe will take 75% (375) off that number as a baseline consumed during the Cataclysm (As we did with our calculations previously). Non-conflict civilian self-defense scenarios and robberies are defined by their rapidity which is primarily down to their short engagement ranges. Statistics on civilian self-defense scenarios reinforce this notion with an accuracy of 60% or more is the norm, and the average number of rounds until incapacitation being 1-2, with lethal hits of around 25% (An Alternate Look at Handgun Stopping Power).To account for the significant impact that blob psychosis would have on firearms owners we will inflate this number to 50 rounds of ammunition per death. From this value, we can determine that the process of expending 75% of the total estimated amount of civilian ammunition at the rate of 50 rounds per death would result in the killing of an absurd 800  million people (and the wounding of 2.4 billion) with the average gun owner being responsible for 11 deaths, which is impossible on so many different levels. Using the same value of 40 billion civilian rounds total to only cause 2 million civilian deaths (the approximate total dead we arrived at for the military) result in a ratio of 20,000 rounds fired for every death. \n\n\nAmmunition becomes a more desirable and thus expensive commodity in zones with high conflict, causing a constriction effect on the usage of ammunition. For example, a recent poll by Southwick Associates of ammunition consumers found that 80 percent of polled gun owners had reduced/canceled shooting-related activities due to the recent scarcity of ammunition (American Rifleman/Southwick Associates). This trend extends to even violent non-state actors such as insurgents who have gone as far as having \"principles designed to prohibit shooting or stealing from members of friendly civilian populations or principles designed to conserve ammunition supplies. The threat of sanction, ranging from removing individuals from operational duties, to humiliation or ostracism, to death (in the extreme), reinforces such regulations\"(Small Arms Survey 2005 Chp 7 pg 188).\n\n\nThis piece has gone on for long enough but, but the US Law Enforcement agencies are no better, with an estimated 1.6 small arms to every officer within the US(Estimating Global Law Enforcement Firearms Numbers 2018). If you want to read more about the abundance of small arms owned by the US's Law Enforcement a link is in the sources.\n\n\nThe last point I'll make is that civilian and military production of ammunition and the corresponding stability in the strategic reserve of ammunition that the US military possesses is considered a major part of national security by the Joint Munitions Command (Small Arms Ammunition Production and Acquisition Strategy for the US Army 1995 pg 9) . Regardless of the blob's influence, the US government would ensure that the production, stockpiling, conservation, and logistical dissemination of ammunition to the law enforcement, civilians (indirectly), and the military would continue until the day the government fell and the world ended. For example, during a major ammunition shortage at the beginning of 2004 \"the Pentagon imported 130 million cartridges from the United Kingdom in June 2004, and awarded contracts to Israeli Military Industries and Winchester Ammunition, commissioning each to produce 70 million more 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm cartridges (Leser, 2004; Merle, 2004). In January 2005, a news report suggested that the United States intended to purchase 300 million 5.56 mm cartridges, for around USD 62.5 million, from Taiwan (AFP, 2005). Private contractors have been approached about supplementing supply from Lake City on a regular basis (Wingfield, 2004); more than a dozen ammunition manufacturers responded, in September 2004, to the US Army\u2019s draft request for proposals, involving 500 million cartridges per year (5.56 mm rifle cartridges as well as 7.62 mm and .50 calibre machine-gun cartridges) (Scully, 2004)\"\n\n\nAgain sorry for the wall of text, this ballooned massively beyond the scope I originally had in mind.\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2008/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2008-Chapter-03-EN.pdf\n\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home\n\nhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2005/050925-israel-bullets.htm\n\nhttps://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a513086.pdf\n\nhttps://www.nationalguard.mil/Features/2017/Operation-Patriot-Bandoleer/\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Law-Enforcement-Firearms-Numbers.pdf\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2012/eng/Small-Arms-Survey-2012-Chapter-03-EN.pdf\n\nhttps://www.nssf.org/articles/nssf-releases-firearms-production-figures/\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf\n\nhttp://www.activeresponsetraining.net/an-alternate-look-at-handgun-stopping-power\n\nhttps://www.americanrifleman.org/content/survey-indicates-ammo-shortage-likely-to-continue/\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2005/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2005-Chapter-07-EN.pdf\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2005/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2005-Chapter-01-EN.pdf", "Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021) Notes from Toyota Motors (TM) 2020 full year Earnings Call (13 May 2021)\n\nWhy do you care?

Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.\n\nNext the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!\n\nNext, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:\n\n>\u201cBy 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs\u201d\n\nFrom later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:\n\n>\u201cWhat does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.\u201d\n\nThen they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:\n\n>\u201cAnd globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.\u201d\n\nFollowed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:\n\n>\u201cat the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. \u201c\n\nAnd\n\n>\u201cSo for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%\u201d\n\nDid you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.\n\nNext the BIG question: \u201c**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?\u201d\n\nWell:\n\n>\u201cThe supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors\u201d\n\nCompare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:\n\n>\u201cyes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  \n>  \n>This is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nAm I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:\n\n>\u201cThe semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves\u201d\n\nThen another important question \u201cyou also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?\u201d\n\nRemember the customer! Here\u2019s part of their answer:\n\n>\u201cAnd for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  \n>  \n>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  \n>  \n>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.\u201d\n\nSo the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions.", "recap  Stocks held in check in front of key events this week\nToday's trade started on a more upbeat note. The main indices enjoyed a positive standing in the early going, supported by gains in some mega cap stocks. Apple (AAPL 153.83, +2.80, +1.9%) led the charge in that respect after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $199 price target.\n\nThings were more shaky under the surface, though, as investors played a waiting game ahead of key events later this week, including Fed Chair Powell's monetary policy testimony before Senate and House committees on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, followed by the February Employment Report on Friday.\n\nEven at midday, when the main indices traded near their best levels of the day, decliners led advancers by a 4-to-3 margin at the NYSE and a 5-to-3 margin at the Nasdaq. \n\nUnderlying weakness became more apparent as mega cap strength started to fade. This coincided with selling efforts ramping up in the Treasury market. The 2-yr note yield, which stood at 4.83% before the stock market opened, rose five basis points to 4.91%. The 10-yr note yield, which stood at 3.90% before the stock market opened, rose two basis points to 3.98%.\n\nThe main indices spent most of the afternoon in a slow grind lower, ultimately settling near their lows for the day. At the close, decliners led advancers by a roughly 2-to-1 margin at both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. \n\nRoughly half of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed with a gain, but moves in either direction were modest in scope. The only sector to move more than 1.0% was materials (-1.7%), reflecting potential concerns about China providing a 2023 growth forecast of around 5.0% that was more conservative than expected. On the flip side, gains in Apple propelled information technology (+0.5%) to the top spot on the leaderboard. \n\nSeparately, small cap and mid cap stocks underperformed by a notable margin today presumably on concerns about the U.S. economy weakening in the months ahead as the Fed continues to raise rates. The Russell 2000 fell 1.5% and the S&P Mid Cap 400 dropped 1.2%. \n\nNasdaq Composite: +11.6% YTD\nRussell 2000: +7.9% YTD\nS&P Midcap 400: +7.9% YTD\nS&P 500: +5.4% YTD\nDow Jones Industrial Average: +0.9% YTD\nToday's economic data was limited to the January Factory Orders, which declined 1.6% month-over-month in January (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) following a downwardly revised 1.7% increase (from 1.8%) in December. Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.7% month-over-month after declining 0.6% in December. \n\nThe key takeaway from the report was the strength (and rebound) seen in nondefense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft. Shipments of these same goods, which factor into GDP forecasts, were up 1.1% after declining 0.6% in December.\nMarket participants will receive the following economic data tomorrow:\n\n10:00 ET: January Wholesale Inventories (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%; prior 0.1%)\n15:00 ET: January Consumer Credit (Briefing.com consensus $22.90 bln; prior $11.60 bln)\nOverseas: \nEurope: DAX +0.5%, FTSE -0.2%, CAC +0.3%\nAsia: Nikkei +1.1%, Hang Seng +0.2%, Shanghai -0.2%\nCommodities: \n\nCrude Oil +0.74 @ 80.53\nNat Gas -0.39 @ 2.75\nGold +0.70 @ 1854.90\nSilver -0.12 @ 21.13\nCopper +0.02 @ 4.08\nSpotlight Comment: Ciena's supply chain keeps improving, fueling solid JanQ results & raised FY23 sales guidance\n\nResembling last quarter, Ciena (CIEN 50.89, +1.80, +3.7%) delivered Q1 (Jan) results that could not have gotten much better, driven by a continuation of supply chain improvements and resilient demand. These dynamics allowed the networking equipment supplier to crush its revenue forecast while easily topping consensus on its bottom line. Meanwhile, CIEN raised its FY23 (Oct) revenue forecast. The excellent Q1 numbers are igniting solid price action, propelling shares toward levels not reached since immediately following its cheery Q4 (Oct) results in early December.\n\nThe combination of improving supply chains and sustained demand resulted in CIEN's best revenue quarter ever, boasting growth of 25.1% yr/yr to $1.06, outpacing its forecast of $910-990 mln handily. Profitability was also a positive standout, with adjusted operating margins expanding by 80 bps yr/yr to 12.6%. These attributes fueled CIEN's solid adjusted EPS growth of 36.2% yr/yr to $0.64.\nTo put the magnitude of CIEN's past supply woes into perspective, its backlog grew from $1.2 bln in FY20 to $4.2 bln entering FY23. In Q1, CIEN started to see its backlog decline slightly, helping explain its exceptional revenue growth.\nIt is important to note that CIEN's supply chain has yet to fully recover; CEO Gary Smith pointed out some persistent volatility in component deliveries. Nevertheless, component availability continued to trend in a positive direction in Q1, a promising indicator of the company's expectation for gradual supply chain improvements as it moves through the year, consistent with what it stated last quarter.\nAlso consistent with CIEN's remarks from Q4 (Oct) was the demand backdrop. CIEN has not changed its bullish tone on the fundamental drivers of long-term demand, including 5G, cloud, AI, and automation. These trends require ever-increasing network capacity to reduce latency and utilize power consumption efficiently, benefiting CIEN.\nPeer Cisco (CSCO) shared similar comments, noting that even as some customers slow spending in some areas, their digital transformations remain vital to their organization's success.\nCIEN remains upbeat that the improvements it saw during the past couple of quarters will continue throughout FY23, illuminated by its raised revenue growth forecast to +20-22% from +16-18%. CIEN also expects its adjusted gross margins to remain around 42-44% for the year due to a shift in product mix toward more line systems and early builds coming online, consistent with what CIEN has noted in previous quarters.\nAfter CSCO's encouraging JanQ report last week, fueled by an improving supply situation, we commented on how it should impact other networking equipment names, such as CIEN. Potential concerns remain lingering in the distance, such as weakness overseas, where CIEN is focused on driving growth and a highly-fluid supply chain environment. Still, with such a significant backlog, CIEN has excellent visibility into demand, buoying its confidence in capturing additional market share over the next few years.\n\nToday's News Summary:\nFor a full rundown of today's market and after hours developments, see Live In Play\n\nEarnings/Guidance (Full Earnings Calendar):\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent (AMH) reaffirms FY23 core FFO guidance in investor presentation\nApartment Income REIT Corp.

Silver's unsurpassed thermal and electrical conductivity among metals means it cannot easily be replaced by less expensive materials.  \n>  \n>For example, small quantities of silver are used as **contacts in electrical switches:** join the contacts, and the switch is on; separate them and the switch is off. Whether turning on a bedroom light using a conventional switch or turning on a microwave using a **membrane switch,** the result is the same: the current can pass through only when the  contacts are joined. **Automobiles** are full of contacts that control  electronic features, and so are consumer appliances. **Industrial strength switches** use silver, too.  \n>  \n>How does silver get from the earth to these electronic devices? Silver comes from silver mines or from lead and zinc mines from which  silver is a by-product. Smelting and refining removes silver from the ore. Then, the silver is usually shaped into bars or grains.\u00a0Electronics demand silver of the highest purity: 99.99% pure, also known  as having a fineness of 999.9.  \n>  \n>Dissolving pure silver in nitric acid produces silver nitrate, which can be formed into powder or flakes. This material, in turn, can be fabricated into contacts or silver pastes, like conductive paste made with a silver-palladium alloy.  \n>  \n>**Silver paste** has many uses, such as the membrane switch already  mentioned and the **rear defrost in many cars.** In electronics, **circuit  paths,** as well as passive components called **multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs),** rely on silver paste. One of the fastest growing uses of silver paste is in photovoltaic cells for the production of **solar energy.**  \n>  \n>**Nanosilver**, silver with an extremely small particle size (1-100  nanometers, that is 1-100 billionths of a meter), provides a new  frontier for technological innovation, requiring much smaller amounts of silver to get the job done. **Printed electronics** work by using nanosilver conductive inks. One example of a printed electronic is the **electrode in a supercapacitor,** which can charge and discharge repeatedly  and quickly. **Regenerative breaking** is an automotive innovation that  allows the **kinetic energy of a slowing vehicle to be stored in a supercapacitor for reuse.** **Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags** offer another powerful application of printed electronics. These tags are **better than bar codes** for tracking inventory because they store more  information and can be read from a greater distance, even without a direct line of sight.  \n>  \n>Silver has its place in **consumer electronics,** too. (...) **Light emitting diodes (LEDs)** also use silver electrodes to produce low-level, energy efficient light. \\[Plasma TV's also used silver electrodes for higher quality image. In modern **flexible displays, silver nano-wires** is better than indium-tin oxide (ITO), due to ITO's brittleness/fragility vs. silver nano-wires flexibility. And [this researcher found his **new silver electrode**](https://www.materialstoday.com/optical-materials/news/silver-film-helps-free-light-from-oleds/) made the **OLED's** 20% brighter than ITO's, by liberating otherwise trapped light in the light emitting part of the OLED (in usual waveguiding, almost 80% of the light gets trapped inside the OLED (wasted energy/light)). --Ed.\\] (...)  \n>  \n>Another electronic application of silver is in **batteries** that employ silver oxide or silver zinc alloys. These light-weight, high-capacity  batteries perform **better at high temperature than other batteries.**  Silver-oxide is used in **button batteries** that power cameras and watches,  as well as in **aerospace and defense** applications. **Silver-zinc batteries**  offer an alternative to lithium batteries for laptop computers and  electric cars. *\\[See article by* [*EVReporter*](https://evreporter.com/zinc-based-battery-technology/)*,* [*research progress on rechargability*](https://spectrum.ieee.org/zincbased-batteries-can-provide-more-energy-safety-than-liion) *at ieee.org* ***\"Silver-zinc shows power not seen with lithium-ion\u201d****), and an interesting and good* [*PDF on Battery Technologies & Silver*](https://www.silverinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BatteryTechnologiesBackgrounder.pdf) *from The Silver Institute, including an encounter of Volta and Napoleon. --Ed.\\]*  \n>  \n>On the cutting edge of technology are **superconductors.** Silver is not a  superconductor, but **when paired with one, the two together can transmit electricity even faster than the superconductor alone.** At very low  temperatures, superconductors carry electricity with little or no  electrical resistance. They can be used to generate **magnetic energy for  turning motors** or propelling **magnetic levitation trains.**  \n>  \n>**The myriad applications of silver in electronics offer an eye-opening  view into how one of the most famous metals in history has become a  cutting edge material of the future.** Due in part to its unique property  of having the highest thermal and electrical conductivity of all metals,  **silver is often a must-have over other, less expensive materials.**\n\nSource: [https://geology.com/articles/uses-of-silver/](https://geology.com/articles/uses-of-silver/) \n\n\u00a0 \n\n>Silver is found in **virtually every electronic device.** If it has an on/off  button, it\u2019s likely that silver is inside.  \n>  \n>(...)  \n>  \n>**Silver membrane switches, which require only a light touch, are used  in buttons on televisions, telephones, microwave ovens, children\u2019s toys  and computer keyboards. These switches are highly reliable and last for millions of on/off cycles. Silver is also used in conventional switches like those used for controlling room lights.**  \n>  \n>**For printed circuit boards, used in consumer items from mobile phones  to computers, silver-based inks and films are applied to composite  boards to create\u00a0electrical pathways.** Similarly, silver-based inks  produce RFID tags (radio frequency identification) antennas used in  hundreds of millions of products to prevent theft and allow easy inventory control.

At this point many still used cattle for barter in India, but over time they gradually found precious metals to be much easier to trade fairly with).

In 1835 the Rupee was made uniform by Indian law, but then later debased again, as is always the case in the history of currency.

Many have been solved, but one of the most difficult aspects to recreate digitally is scarcity. Time will tell if Bitcoin will be 'it,' or whether there will be an infinity of similar blockchains equally popular, effectively relinquishing this crucial monetary aspect of limits to supply. **This; one of the most fascinating of natures physical metals has going for them, and which have seemingly made them nigh eternal monies among humans; they are SCARCE & CANNOT be duplicated.** The very nature of digi-land, is that everything can be copied / duplicated.

They are the foundation on which modern technology is built. From solar panels to  semiconductors, wind turbines to advanced batteries for storage and transportation, the world needs  critical minerals to build these products. Simply put, there is no energy transition without critical  minerals, which is why their supply chain resilience has become an increasing priority for advanced  economies. By growing Canadian expertise at every point along the critical mineral value chain \u2014 from  mining to manufacturing to recycling \u2014 we will create good jobs, build a strong, globally competitive  Canadian economy, and take real action to fight climate change. As a result of this strategy, we will  also better position Canada as a reliable supplier of critical mineral resources to our allies. The global demand for critical minerals and the manufactured products they go into is required to  increase significantly in the coming decades to enable transition to a green and digital economy.  Current forecasts show supply deficits if critical mineral production, processing and recycling  are not increased. At the same time, the production and processing of many critical minerals are  geographically concentrated, making supply vulnerable to economic, geopolitical, environmental, and  other risks. With its vast resources and manufacturing capacity, Canada is well positioned to become  a secure and reliable supplier of critical minerals and value-added products for global markets.  Growing our supply of critical minerals and the products they go into presents a generational  opportunity with domestic and global benefits. To fully seize this opportunity, we must ensure that  value is added to the entire supply chain, including exploration, extraction, intermediate processing,  advanced manufacturing, and recycling. We must create the necessary conditions for Canadian  companies to grow, scale-up, and expand globally in markets that depend on critical minerals.  Our efforts must be consistent with Canada\u2019s priorities and objectives including environmental  protection and conservation, safe and responsible labour practices, and respect for the rights of  Indigenous peoples. By growing and building our expertise at each point along the critical mineral supply chain, Canada  can grow its economy from coast to coast to coast, fight climate change at home and around the  world, and improve the resiliency of our supply chain and those of our allies to future disruptions.  Importantly, this must be done in a way that advances the Government of Canada\u2019s commitment  to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples through meaningful consultation, early and ongoing  engagement, investments in capacity supports, environmental stewardship, community safety, and  economic opportunities for Indigenous peoples.  In addition, critical mineral development needs to be sustainable and create nature-forward outcomes  with minimal environmental footprint and leading-edge conservation and reclamation practices (i.e.,  mine closure). A \u201cnature forward\u201d approach to critical minerals development and sourcing means  incorporating practices that work to prevent biodiversity loss, protect species at risk , and support  nature protection. Innovative ways to capture value from alternative sources and waste streams,  recycling technologies, and traditional Indigenous conservation practices are all examples of \u201cnature  forward\u201d solutions.  The Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy will empower businesses, workers, and communities across  Canada to seize this generational opportunity. Accelerating the development of Canada\u2019s critical  mineral sector, while ensuring environmental sustainability and respecting the rights of Indigenous  peoples, is essential if Canada is to seize upon this generational opportunity and position itself as a  stable supplier of critical minerals, both at home and abroad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9w30mj9zotta1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5749e377bd7b540cc3ab709505001cb329177d6\n\n[LOOKS LIKE CANADA HAS SOME INTERESTED ANCHOR INVESTORS & ENTITIES AS WELL......   \\(\\*\\*\\*NANO-ONE is even pursuing NIOBIUM BATTERIES MANUFACTURING WITH CCBM!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/74nsucd4ptta1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbaa26f30a2627f216800fb689aa850bd19ec550)\n\n## February 15, 2022 ~Nano One Successfully Completes Phase One of its Co-Development Agreement with Niobium Producer CBMM  [Nano One Successfully Completes Phase One of its Co-Development Agreement with Niobium Producer CBMM | Nano One Materials Corp.](https://nanoone.ca/news/news-releases/nano-one-successfully-completes-phase-one-of-its-co-development-agreement-with-niobium-producer-cbmm/)\n\n# ~April 11, 2023 ~BATTLE FOR RARE EARTH MINERALS~ OPINION~\n\nBy **John Denslinger is a former executive VP Murata, president SyChip Wireless, and president/CEO ECIA, the industry\u2019s trade association. His career spans 40 years in electronics**\n\n[Battle for rare earth minerals | John Denslinger, Latest Articles News (electronics-sourcing.com)](https://electronics-sourcing.com/2023/04/11/battle-for-rare-earth-minerals/)\n\n**To some, \u2018battle\u2019 might be overkill describing the outlook for rare earth minerals. Afterall, these minerals are actually abundant and found on every continent. Like most battles though, engagement with opposition occurs on multiple fronts. Such is the case for rare earth: trophy minerals are seldom extracted from a single, concentrated deposit; mineral processing entails a complex and expensive transformation to a useful alloy; and unfortunately, the US finds itself in a weak starting position with just a single operating mine and zero refining. Three massive fronts to remedy if we are serious about restoring one of America\u2019s vital supply chains.**\n\n**While 17 elements are classified as rare earth, neodymium (Nd) may epitomize America\u2019s rare earth saga. NdFeB magnets are the devices that power motion. They are synonymous with innovative technology such as EVs, wind turbines, robots and a host of strategic defense applications. More than a dozen countries have documented reserves including the US and Canada. Brazil and Vietnam have huge reserves but mine just a tiny fraction. The rare earth powerhouse is definitely China with 40 per cent of the identified world reserves according to the last DoE published assessment. As for mine production, China leads again with 58 per cent of global output, 91 per cent of worldwide refining and 87 per cent of the oxide separation. And China excels at manufacturing too, producing a mind boggling 92 per cent of the world\u2019s magnets.**\n\n**By comparison, the US has but one mine: MP Materials operating in Mountain Pass, CA. Even more troublesome, all of the mine\u2019s output is shipped to China for processing. It seems every aspect of our rare earth supply chain starts with China and ends with China. This is not the best scenario given today\u2019s geopolitical theatrics. No wonder rare earth production is now a Federal priority.**\n\n**Domestic sourcing is limited to MP Materials which has no local rivals and no near-term competitive threats. With federal money readily available and EV manufacturers desperate for local sourcing, MP Materials announced plans to spend $700M building a complete end-to-end supply chain that adds refining, metal extraction, alloying and magnet manufacturing to its mining expertise. Recycling capability may also be included. The additional processing will take place in Fort Worth, TX with production start-up slated for late 2023. Another encouraging sign, GM recently formalized a long agreement with MP for alloy and finished magnets for GM\u2019s EV programs. Having the financial backing of a Fortune 25 company almost assures the venture\u2019s success.**\n\n**Will we see additional onshore mining anytime soon? It\u2019s not likely within the continental US unless national security concerns prevail over a NIMBY regulatory history. On one hand, the Bureau of Land management is reluctant to grant surface mining permits on federal land. As for non-federal land, endless legal challenges by local communities and environmental groups effectively delays large scale domestic projects for years.**\n\n**As mentioned, neodymium (Nd) is just one of 17 rare earth minerals, but the hardship story for each is much the same. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act set forth new sourcing conditions. It subsidized consumers based on US content with specific reference to mineral content in batteries. Qualifying mineral content could be US or from countries having a free-trade agreement with the US, but such agreements have yet to be negotiated with any western ally or resource rich country. So, America\u2019s businesses can only look to near-shore USMCA partners Mexico and Canada for sourcing. In the meantime, China dominates the battle in rare earth minerals.**\n\n# APRIL 10, 2023 ~Trade war looms over rare earths~\n\n[Trade war looms over rare earths | The Manila Times](https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/04/10/opinion/editorial/trade-war-looms-over-rare-earths/1886446)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gzlpfolutta1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=c64c48b49ed0104bc0d87c141aa9afc100543dfb\n\nRare earth magnets are used in motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and other products such as wind turbines, cruise missiles and smartphones.\n\nLast year, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm raised concerns that \"critical minerals could be vulnerable to manipulation as we've seen in other areas, or weaponization.\"\n\nThe US, which is heavily dependent on China for rare earths, has been scrambling to find ways to keep its supply chain open.\n\nContrary to what their name suggests, rare earths are abundant. They are three times more plentiful than copper and twice more than zinc, the two most commonly used industrial metals.\n\nThere are an estimated 120 million tons of rare earth deposits worldwide, and the bulk of 44 million tons is in China.\n\nRefining rare earths, however, is a tedious, toxic process. It creates a dangerous cocktail of wastewater, heavy metals and substances such as cadmium, lead and radioactive thorium.\n\nChina, however, appears willing to gloss over these environmental and health issues to provide its industries supplied with rare earths.\n\nLike fossil fuels, the supply of rare earths is finite. Demand, however, will continue to grow as the world switches to alternative sources of energy.\n\nElectric vehicles, the transportation mode that will eventually replace internal-combustion cars, need magnets fashioned from rare earths for their motors. Eventually, EVs will be powered by batteries with rare earth components.\n\nOther than electric cars, rare earths have found their way into a wide range of industrial applications. It's no wonder there is a frenzied race to corner the rare-earth market.\n\nChina is leading the race right now, and that's keeping other industrial giants uneasy. In 2010, China froze exports of rare earths to Japan for two years following a dispute over the Senaku Islands.\n\nSince then, Japan and its Western allies like the US, Canada and Australia have been keeping their R&D labs busy looking for ways to develop their own sources of rare earths.\n\nJapan has decided to focus its search not on land, but offshore.\n\nA recent Japanese study claims that an estimated 16 million tons of rare earths could be extracted from the oceans, enough to supply global demand on a \"semi-infinite\" basis.\n\n\"We are not talking about some dream technology of the distant future. We are conducting studies to make this possible,\" the study's author, Yutaro Takaya, was quoted as saying.\n\nDredging the seabed for rare earths will not only be very expensive; it will also wreak havoc on marine ecosystems, critics of the study argue. But Takaya counters that aside from boosting Japan's \"resource security,\" mining the seas for rare earths \"can also serve as a diplomatic card. Japan will be able to say, 'if prices are made to go above this level, we can look to developing sea-bottom rare earths'.\"\n\nChina, however, is way ahead of the pack in scouring the seas for rare earths. State-funded surveys from 2011 to 2020 revealed \"potentially high-yield deposits\" of various essential industrial minerals from nickel to rare earths in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and \u2014 much closer to home \u2014 the South China Sea.\n\nThat pretty much explains China's compulsion for claiming practically all of the South China Sea as its territory.\n\nThe potential mother lode of precious metals beneath the disputed waters could also explain the US' determination to keep China's aggressive moves in the region in check.\n\nIt is woeful that countries like the Philippines, which should be the main beneficiaries of the bounty from the South China Sea, have been reduced to pawns in another trade war between global powers.\n\n# [Home - NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evtcd9igrtta1.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada4159eab4b3ade5172f94cf587a28bb0d44bea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgyd8z2nrtta1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=9446096be93c9e13cd85d41de927ee354e937bd1\n\n# Please see Jim's responses to RELEVANT questions posed for comment-3/17/2022.\n\n*\\~A) Could you comment on what the production of higher purity Niobium & Titanium could be utilized for once realized?*\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n\"***If the higher purity niobium and titanium intermediates that L3 was able to produce at bench-scale are replicated and proven at demonstration scale, this would put us in a position to more easily move to other products beyond those outlined in our 2019 Feasibility Study.

This instability has triggered volatility in financial markets, with South Korea's stock index (KOSPI) and ETFs showing declines. Key sectors, including semiconductors, EV batteries, and automotive, could be at risk. The economy, already fragile, may face further challenges despite reassurances from the central bank and finance ministry.\n\n# Analysis\n\n1. **Political Instability**: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempted martial law and subsequent reversal, coupled with impeachment proceedings, highlight significant political uncertainty. This has shaken investor confidence in South Korea's economic stability, a key factor in global markets.\n2. **Market Reaction**:\n   * The KOSPI closed down 1.4%, reflecting immediate concerns over the country's performance and potential economic fallout.\n   * The iShares MSCI South Korea ETF, which trades in New York, saw a sharp drop but recovered slightly, signaling cautious optimism or stabilizing sentiments among investors.\n3. **Sector Impact**:\n   * **Semiconductors**: Due to their global prominence, companies like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix may face heightened scrutiny. Political instability could disrupt supply chains or foreign investments.\n   * **EV Batteries and Automotives**: LG Energy Solution, SK Innovation, Hyundai, and Kia are major players in the electric vehicle ecosystem. These sectors are sensitive to broader economic trends and depend on a stable political environment for sustained growth.\n4. **Economic Context**:\n   * South Korea narrowly avoided a recession in the last quarter and is grappling with slowing growth.\n   * The central bank's bank'scted rate cut last week underscores economic fragility, which may be exacerbated by political unrest.\n\n# Forecast\n\n1. **Short-Term**:\n   * **Market Volatility**: South Korean equities, particularly those of high-profile companies like Samsung and Hyundai, are likely to experience heightened volatility as the political situation evolves.\n   * **Currency Pressure**: The Korean won could face depreciation against major currencies due to reduced investor confidence.\n2. **Medium-Term**:\n   * **Economic Slowdown**: Prolonged instability may dampen domestic consumption, foreign investments, and trade, leading to weaker GDP growth.\n   * **Policy Responses**: The central bank may take further easing measures or introduce stimulus packages to counter potential economic drag.\n3. **Long-Term**:\n   * **Investor Caution**: Political instability may lead to re-evaluating South Korea\u2019s profile among foreign investors, especially in tech and manufacturing.\n   * **Sector Opportunities**: Global demand for semiconductors and EV batteries could offset domestic turbulence, allowing companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and LG Energy Solution to maintain competitiveness.", "My complaint to the New Zealand government regarding gender budgeting.

See Annex 1\n\n### Definition\n\nGender budgeting is described in a number of ways and always includes both women and men.\n\n* \u201cGender budgeting is about ensuring that the different needs and experiences of women, men, and gender diverse people are considered in the budget process and in the allocation of funding and resources.\u201d[1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote1sym)\n* The 2023 Budget says \u201cGender budgeting is a powerful tool for understanding how and to what extent people will be affected differently by initiatives depending on their gender.

Although the formally stated goal of gender budgeting is to benefit both women and men, it is overwhelmingly understood to be about addressing women\u2019s issues. This difference between formally stated goals and personal conceptualisation creates a bias leading to discrimination against men and boys. Staff who have internalised gender budgeting as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d will not give the required attention to gender budgeting issues for men and boys.\n\nThe conceptualisation of gender budgeting as being about women is seen in the development, execution and discussion of gender budgeting.\n\n### Process \u2013 Gender budgeting trial only evaluated the impact on women and girls\n\nThe **process** of applying a \u2018gender lens\u2019 must not discriminate. It must make it possible *and* likely to identify and address issues for men and boys *as well as* for women and girls. Unfortunately, the development and testing of the gender budgeting pilot discriminated against men and boys.\n\nA briefing[3](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote3sym) to the Minister for Women, *\u201cReview of the Gender Budgeting Pilot and next steps\u201d*, describes the gender budgeting pilot. \u201cThe pilot was intended to incorporate a gender lens across initiatives, to identify policies that had a direct and/or indirect impact on improving outcomes for women and girls and policies that have a negative or unintended effect on women so that these effects could be challenged and/or amended.\u201d **There is no indication that the gender budgeting pilot was intended to identify impacts for men and boys**.\n\nThe briefing describes the three key questions asked to participating agencies. **None of the questions include men and boys**. The questions were:\n\n* What kind of impact does the initiative have on **women and girls** overall?\n* What kind of impact does the initiative have on **w\u0101hine** M\u0101ori?\n* Does the initiative impact on another specific group of **women and girls**?\n\n### Execution and outcomes \u2013 Gender budgeting only applied to women and girls.\n\nThe **execution** of the gender budgeting must not discriminate. Intending to include issues for men and boys as well as for women and girls must be demonstrated in the gender analysis and inclusion of experts for both men\u2019s issues and women\u2019s issues,\n\nThe **outcomes** must not discriminate. Both women and men must benefit from gender budgeting. The Gender Budgeting section of the 2023 Budget only focuses entirely on women, even when budget allocations provides greater benefit to men.

It is not sufficient to rely on the Ministry for Women to provide all of the expertise. The Ministry does not have a mandate to have expertise on men\u2019s issues. Nor is it sufficient to simply have men present if those men are not providing expertise on men\u2019s issues if experts in women's issues are present.\n* Evaluate the impact of budgeting decisions on men and boys as well as women and girls.\n\n## Human rights obligations\n\nInternational human rights law requires the government to ensure equal enjoyment of rights for women and men. See Article 3 of both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There is also a\u00a0non-derogable obligation to immediately eliminate discrimination.\n\n## Action required\n\nThe New Zealand government is obligated to not discriminate and to prevent discrimination.

Regarding the issue of the treasury using a gender lens, I would like to point out that, should the treasury decide to adopt a gender lens, due diligence requires considering both women's and men's gender issues. Currently, the Ministry for Women is the government's gender expert, but having and maintaining expertise on men's gender issues is outside of their mandate.

For the first time, Budget 2023 includes a gender budgeting \u2018snapshot\u2019. Gender budgeting is a powerful tool for understanding how and to what extent people will be affected differently by initiatives depending on their gender. Applying a gender lens ensures that budgets can support a gender-equitable, inclusive future and do not embed inequalities further. Fifteen agencies (triple the number of agencies from last year\u2019s pilot) participated in the Gender Budgeting Exercise for Budget 2023 and covered 27 initiatives. Manat\u016b W\u0101hine Ministry for Women supported agencies to identify the anticipated impacts on women and girls, particularly for M\u0101ori, through a Gender Budgeting Toolkit. The initiatives included in the exercise are likely to achieve targeted outcomes for wh\u0101nau, pregnant women, sole parents and sole mothers, w\u0101hine M\u0101ori, Pacific women, disabled women, working women and \u0101konga students. Building on the success of a prior prototype, the\u00a0**Ng\u0101 Tini Whet\u016b**\u00a0initiative will provide targeted support for 650 w\u0101hine hap\u016b and their wh\u0101nau and tamariki. It will deliver this by extending its focus to include the wellbeing of hap\u016b m\u0101m\u0101, wh\u0101nau and p\u0113pi in their first 1,000 days, supporting a healthy start to life.\n2. Nearly half of all \u0101konga (48 percent) in schools receiving or eligible for the\u00a0**Ka Ora, Ka Ako Healthy School Lunches programme**\u00a0are girls. While girls directly benefit from the same overall positive impacts, nutritional lunches also improve the regularity and health of menstrual cycles, which is directly linked to nutrition. This mana-enhancing initiative reduces stress and grocery bills for wh\u0101nau. The programme also supports teen parent units, providing healthy lunches to w\u0101hine hap\u016b, which supports their immediate health, mitigates the health risks of food insecurity, and is the earliest possible intervention for their babies.\n3. Women have different experiences in the world of work than men, and this can put women at an economic disadvantage. Compared to men, women experience higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, often work in less secure, more precarious employment, and undertake greater caring and family responsibilities. Pacific women are a priority focus under the\u00a0**Pacific Employment Action Plan**. Funded projects including Tupu Tai, a public sector internship programme for Pacific students which attracts a high proportion of women (60 percent to 70 percent), and the Pacific cadetship scheme, which has at least 50 percent of placements reserved for women will help address systemic workforce issues affecting Pacific women and girls.\n4. Funding to permanently reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance will support sole parents and disabled people and their carers to enter higher education and training. Since 2021, the initiative has supported approximately 5,000 clients, of whom 90 percent have been women. The flow-on impacts for tamariki and the intergenerational benefits of parents holding educational qualifications will be particularly beneficial for sole parents, who make up 75 percent of clients and who are disproportionately women. The long-term impacts of improving women\u2019s education, which supports entry to higher-pay employment, can reduce gender and ethnic pay gaps. The\u00a0**wage supplement to replace the minimum wage exemption**\u00a0is expected to directly improve the incomes and wellbeing of disabled women, including w\u0101hine M\u0101ori, alleviating financial stress and aiding independence.\n5. Gender analysis of the\u00a0**Industry Transformation Plans**\u00a0(ITP) has highlighted an opportunity to address the underrepresentation of women in male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and technology. The\u00a0**ITP Digital Technology package**\u00a0aims to increase women\u2019s participation in the technology sector from 27 percent to 50 percent by 2030, through initiatives such as \u2018Learn while you earn\u2019 opportunities and supporting employers to foster attractive, supportive working environments to attract and retain a diverse workforce.\n6. Transport agencies participated in the pilot for the first time, recognising the gender dimension of transport. As women are more likely to have lower income levels than men, work part time or casually, and have greater caring responsibilities, they are more likely to rely on public transport and use it in off-peak hours. Women, particularly M\u0101ori and Pacific women, are also less likely than men to have driver licences, affecting their independence and access to employment and training. Budget 2023 includes funding to support the delivery, connectivity, and sustainability of public transport across New Zealand and enhance women\u2019s employment opportunities. For example, the\u00a0**Future of Rail**\u00a0initiative aims to increase the number of women working in KiwiRail\u2019s workforce from 18 percent to 21 percent by 2025. Additional funding to\u00a0**maintain public transport services**\u00a0will ensure everyone in New Zealand has access to safe and reliable public transport, particularly the women and girls who are more reliant on these services or who make multiple trips per day.\n7. Budget 2023 funds several initiatives aimed at supporting victims and survivors of family and sexual violence and eliminating violence, both online and offline. The gendered impacts of\u00a0**abuse in care**\u00a0for women, girls and M\u0101ori cause particular and distinct harms, including medical, emotional and physical harms.\u00a0**Improvements in accessing care records**\u00a0to make fit-for-purpose services will benefit survivors, of whom 40 percent have been identified as women by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care, and support the wider Crown response and redress. One in three women experiences intimate partner violence, and w\u0101hine M\u0101ori are more likely to be subjected to violence than any other ethnicity or gender. Nearly three-quarters of women (73 percent) affected by family violence do not interact with formal services or go through formal channels. Investments in\u00a0**the Violence Help Portal**\u00a0(part of Te Aorerekura) will provide women experiencing violence with increased and faster access to information, advice, referrals and crisis support.\u00a0**Violent misogyny is a risk factor for radicalisation**, and **a common feature of violent extremism and terrorism.**\u00a0Initiatives funded under the\u00a0**Christchurch Call**\u00a0can reduce online and offline violence and violent rhetoric against women and girls, supporting women and girls to stay safe online.\n\n[1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote1anc)[https://women.govt.nz/women-and-work/gender-budgeting](https://women.govt.nz/women-and-work/gender-budgeting)\n\n[2](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote2anc)[https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2023/wellbeing/approach/gender-budgeting.htm](https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2023/wellbeing/approach/gender-budgeting.htm)\n\n[3](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote3anc)[https://women.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2022-08/Advice%202022.05.24%20Proactive%20Release%20of%20Review%20of%20the%20Gender%20Budgeting%20Pilot%20and%20next%20steps.pdf](https://women.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2022-08/Advice%202022.05.24%20Proactive%20Release%20of%20Review%20of%20the%20Gender%20Budgeting%20Pilot%20and%20next%20steps.pdf)", "My complaint to the New Zealand government regarding gender budgeting.

It will deliver this by extending its focus to include the wellbeing of hap\u016b m\u0101m\u0101, wh\u0101nau and p\u0113pi in their first 1,000 days, supporting a healthy start to life.\n2. Nearly half of all \u0101konga (48 percent) in schools receiving or eligible for the\u00a0**Ka Ora, Ka Ako Healthy School Lunches programme**\u00a0are girls. While girls directly benefit from the same overall positive impacts, nutritional lunches also improve the regularity and health of menstrual cycles, which is directly linked to nutrition. This mana-enhancing initiative reduces stress and grocery bills for wh\u0101nau. The programme also supports teen parent units, providing healthy lunches to w\u0101hine hap\u016b, which supports their immediate health, mitigates the health risks of food insecurity, and is the earliest possible intervention for their babies.\n3. Women have different experiences in the world of work than men, and this can put women at an economic disadvantage. Compared to men, women experience higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, often work in less secure, more precarious employment, and undertake greater caring and family responsibilities. Pacific women are a priority focus under the\u00a0**Pacific Employment Action Plan**. Funded projects including Tupu Tai, a public sector internship programme for Pacific students which attracts a high proportion of women (60 percent to 70 percent), and the Pacific cadetship scheme, which has at least 50 percent of placements reserved for women will help address systemic workforce issues affecting Pacific women and girls.\n4. Funding to permanently reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance will support sole parents and disabled people and their carers to enter higher education and training. Since 2021, the initiative has supported approximately 5,000 clients, of whom 90 percent have been women. The flow-on impacts for tamariki and the intergenerational benefits of parents holding educational qualifications will be particularly beneficial for sole parents, who make up 75 percent of clients and who are disproportionately women. The long-term impacts of improving women\u2019s education, which supports entry to higher-pay employment, can reduce gender and ethnic pay gaps. The\u00a0**wage supplement to replace the minimum wage exemption**\u00a0is expected to directly improve the incomes and wellbeing of disabled women, including w\u0101hine M\u0101ori, alleviating financial stress and aiding independence.\n5. Gender analysis of the\u00a0**Industry Transformation Plans**\u00a0(ITP) has highlighted an opportunity to address the underrepresentation of women in male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and technology. The\u00a0**ITP Digital Technology package**\u00a0aims to increase women\u2019s participation in the technology sector from 27 percent to 50 percent by 2030, through initiatives such as \u2018Learn while you earn\u2019 opportunities and supporting employers to foster attractive, supportive working environments to attract and retain a diverse workforce.\n6. Transport agencies participated in the pilot for the first time, recognising the gender dimension of transport. As women are more likely to have lower income levels than men, work part time or casually, and have greater caring responsibilities, they are more likely to rely on public transport and use it in off-peak hours. Women, particularly M\u0101ori and Pacific women, are also less likely than men to have driver licences, affecting their independence and access to employment and training. Budget 2023 includes funding to support the delivery, connectivity, and sustainability of public transport across New Zealand and enhance women\u2019s employment opportunities. For example, the\u00a0**Future of Rail**\u00a0initiative aims to increase the number of women working in KiwiRail\u2019s workforce from 18 percent to 21 percent by 2025. Additional funding to\u00a0**maintain public transport services**\u00a0will ensure everyone in New Zealand has access to safe and reliable public transport, particularly the women and girls who are more reliant on these services or who make multiple trips per day.\n7. Budget 2023 funds several initiatives aimed at supporting victims and survivors of family and sexual violence and eliminating violence, both online and offline. The gendered impacts of\u00a0**abuse in care**\u00a0for women, girls and M\u0101ori cause particular and distinct harms, including medical, emotional and physical harms.\u00a0**Improvements in accessing care records**\u00a0to make fit-for-purpose services will benefit survivors, of whom 40 percent have been identified as women by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care, and support the wider Crown response and redress. One in three women experiences intimate partner violence, and w\u0101hine M\u0101ori are more likely to be subjected to violence than any other ethnicity or gender. Nearly three-quarters of women (73 percent) affected by family violence do not interact with formal services or go through formal channels. Investments in\u00a0**the Violence Help Portal**\u00a0(part of Te Aorerekura) will provide women experiencing violence with increased and faster access to information, advice, referrals and crisis support.\u00a0**Violent misogyny is a risk factor for radicalisation**, and **a common feature of violent extremism and terrorism.**\u00a0Initiatives funded under the\u00a0**Christchurch Call**\u00a0can reduce online and offline violence and violent rhetoric against women and girls, supporting women and girls to stay safe online.\n\n[1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote1anc)[https://women.govt.nz/women-and-work/gender-budgeting](https://women.govt.nz/women-and-work/gender-budgeting)\n\n[2](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote2anc)[https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2023/wellbeing/approach/gender-budgeting.htm](https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2023/wellbeing/approach/gender-budgeting.htm)\n\n[3](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_-8764448508076273521_sdfootnote3anc)[https://women.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2022-08/Advice%202022.05.24%20Proactive%20Release%20of%20Review%20of%20the%20Gender%20Budgeting%20Pilot%20and%20next%20steps.pdf](https://women.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2022-08/Advice%202022.05.24%20Proactive%20Release%20of%20Review%20of%20the%20Gender%20Budgeting%20Pilot%20and%20next%20steps.pdf)", "Sat Nov 13 00:06:04 2021 NYSE:CEO / 120\n\n[If you're interested in a ipo metaverse play, with amazing fundamentals.

Secures Lease Agreement with Tier-1 Agriculture Operator for $36 Million Micro-Grid Project\r   9h\r    \\-7.25%\r   EL CAJON, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 9, 2021 / Solar Integrated Roofing Corp. (OTC PINK:SIRC), an integrated, single-source solar power and roofing systems installation company, today announced that subsidiary USA Solar Networks has secured a lease agreement with Mohave Farms, a tier-1 multi-generational agriculture operator, to build and maintain a $36 million micro-grid project for a 20,000 acre farm near Kingman, Arizona.\r   \r   Per the terms of the agreement, Solar Integrated Roofing Corp. will provide a 3MW solar project as well as an accompanying battery and integrated propane supply system - the proprietary, patented generator systems work in unison with the multiple alternative energy solutions, enabled through an AI-driven power management system.\r   \r   The client will pay Solar Integrated Roofing in exchange for an ongoing lease payment of over $420,000 a month for a 30-year term.

He is selling \"$10B worth of shares\" was news already. It's not news anymore.  It's also concerning how little some of y'all get how this works. I'll clarify. Musk is an insider at Tesla. He made the decision to sell these shares months ago. There are rules in place to stop market timing and they work like this: if Mr. CEO wants to sell shares (for whatever reasons... taxes, doubt, etc) he enters his trades months in advance. He can only sell once a quarter.  When the trade actually goes through, it is \"VWAP'd\". (Volume Weighted Average Price) Split up, because unless we're talking penny stocks, walking up and entering a trade for 5 million shares is going cause a price change. There just isn't enough instantaneous volume on the market to absorb that volume without a major price change, especially not for $1,200 per share Tesla.  In Musk's case, this is a multi-day VWAP, since there are literally SO MANY shares being sold. His broker is selling 100 share bunches ALL DAY and giving him the average price at the end of the day when it's all added up.  So this isn't me being a Tesla bear, but the lack of price collapse is not a sign of anything. It's the system doing what it's literally designed to.

Almost all of the stores are in the United States with a few in Canada and even less in the UK so international expansion is still wide open for them. On their latest call, Niccol said that they are still testing the European market but signs are looking good for further expansion into the EU (mostly the UK and France for now).  2.\t\u2060Piper Sandler came out with a teen survey that said Chipotle was one of the restaurants they would choose the most, alongside Chick Fil A and Starbucks. The majority of Chipotles customers are under 34 and an even greater amount under 24. Their customers are expected to provide a greater lifetime value than other competitors with aging clientele. Young customers also prefer to pay for healthier, quality food versus overly processed foods.  3.\t\u2060The switch to digital as well as the addition of drive thrus boosts profit margin. Mobile ordering also helps stay connected with the younger customers along with data collection  to know the customer better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dip a toe into dark or ghost kitchens to move into areas where the financials of spending a 1-2 million dollars for a physical store don\u2019t make sense. These dark or ghost kitchens will have huge margins. 4.\t\u2060Great management, great financials, no long term debt. Enough cash to pay off any remaining debt. FCF increasing. The physical stores typically pay for themselves around a year and a half. It isn\u2019t a franchise so they keep 100% of the 25% profit margin.  5.\t\u2060Moat. Very few people realize or believe their moat because after all they just make burritos. But McDonald\u2019s just does burgers, Starbucks just makes coffee and dominoes just does pizza. IMO and Morningstar\u2019s opinion they have a wide moat. I believe their moat comes in the form of brand value and pricing power. The chipotle brand is synonymous with quality, similar to Apple. When Apple has a product with a glitch or defect it makes the news where as other brands don\u2019t. When chipotle came out with the original Queso dip people didn\u2019t like it and it made the news. Mis steps for this company are few and far between with the quality of their food (here your probably thinking the food illness problem from a few years ago, I\u2019ll address that below). Because of the brand value, Inflation and price hikes don\u2019t affect the customer loyalty as customers are willing to pay for quality. When they added Carne Asada, they increased the price .25 cents and saw \u201cno degradation\u201d in demand \u201cat all.\u201d Price increases may affect McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and other competitors more as their entire business model is to provide as much cheap food for the lowest cost. Well that cost is crawling up with inflation so the value isn\u2019t as great as it once was. Along with the brand value created pricing power. Pricing power in rising prices without affecting demand but also in the price of the store locations. Strip mall and mall owners often give chipotle a deal on the lease or rent because they know chipotle will drive foot traffic which may help other businesses. A new store typically pays for itself in about a year and a half.  6.   The food poisoning issue seems to be behind them. Almost all large food chains have had their share of food poisoning issues (KFC, Jack in the box, Burger King and more) yet they\u2019re all still around. Chipotles was three years ago, which led to a new CEO with Brian Niccol who came from Taco Bell and is used to running large food chains and has since cleaned up the food illness problems. Long story short, I listened to a podcast with Steve Ells (the founder) where he explained that they disinfect every single item on the menu before it even gets to the store. For example, they boil avocados for 4 seconds to completely kill germs on the outside AND the inside which doesn\u2019t affect flavor (which is new from what they were doing).  7. They basically invented the fast casual form of restaurant. When a new company tries their business model it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe chipotle of\u2026\u201d   Risks that I see (I may miss something but I don\u2019t trust DD without any risks listed)  1.\t\u2060Like Apple\u2019s insistent demand of quality, any food illness problems will hurt their brand value more than others. Food illness is a risk for any restaurant but I believe the news is much more likely to make a big deal about chipotle\u2019s problems than a Taco Bell or other company because they commit themselves to quality. This will in turn crush chipotles brand loyalty. 2.\t\u2060The drive thrus are capital intensive and they haven\u2019t been proven to be successful yet. 3.\t\u2060The demand for superior ingredients are subject to hired risk from the suppliers prices. 4.\t\u2060Competition from other quick service restaurants. 5. The valuation is a lot higher than other restaurants but it\u2019s finding support around the 1790s range.    Obviously I\u2019m very bullish in chipotle. I think it\u2019s a great long term investment. I think a lot of people over look them because the business model is so simple but then again, so is Coca Cola\u2019s. It\u2019s also a lot sexier to tech.   When it comes to Portillo\u2019s, I love it. I grew up on it and in fact I\u2019m having it tonight. I got it shipped to my house since I don\u2019t live by one anymore. My main concern is whether they can teach people what Italian Beef sandwiches are since most people have never heard of it. I just think the upside of chipotle is greater than Portillo\u2019s.](/r/stocks/comments/qr3pha/your_favorite_restaurant_stocks/hk556ax/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 00:49:56 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[The CEO should start tweeting shit like \"Feelin' cute, might sell the company to Saudi Arabia later\" to get more news attention.](/r/stocks/comments/qqyg1b/rivian_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/hk61q4n/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 05:07:11 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Apart form Tsla, what other exclusively-battery-car companies have IPOed?

Most important, PJM did this looking forward rather than the usual approach, which is to build for the first new renewable energy project, then start building for the second project, and not consider the needs of a third or fourth project.

That\u2019s actually a small amount. The gas industry has predicted that pipeline construction costs would average $25 billion per year for 20 years. (Take note, planning ahead when building big is less costly than making many incremental steps and missing the efficiency and economies of scale.)\n\nWe think that PJM and ISO-NE can help their states by adopting forward-looking regional transmission planning that plans for future generation to help states meet their energy-related goals more efficiently and cost-effectively\nhttps://blog.ucsusa.org/mike-jacobs/what-is-the-supply-chain-for-clean-energy-and-climate-change/\n\nA greener path\nChina is making its Belt and Road Initiative more environmentally friendly.

These practices include a sensitive protocol that tests groups of plants to detect even low levels of infection. They also started a clean nursery accreditation program to help nurseries comply with the NPNMPs.\n\n\u201cThrough extensive testing, we have verified that nurseries that fully comply with the NPBMPs have had no detectable Phytophthora in their stock,\u201d said Swiecki. \u201cAgencies that have helped fund this program and others have been able to use clean nursery stock from accredited nurseries for habitat restoration plantings.\u201d\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933880\n\nBlack carbon aerosols heating Arctic: Large contribution from mid-latitude biomass burning\n\nThe year-to-year spring variation in Arctic black carbon (BC) aerosol abundance is strongly correlated with biomass burning in the mid-latitudes.

When it came to deception regarding volunteerism, there were no observed sex differences, suggesting both sexes are equally upset by deception relating to altruistic tendencies.\n\nUsing a continuous measure, Study 2 revealed that men were most likely to cancel their date when lied to about looks, rather than employment or volunteerism. However, there were no sex differences in the likelihood of cancelling a date due to attractiveness deception.

According to the Sleep Foundation, both of these factors \"allow you to catch a quick rest without entering slow-wave sleep and feeling excessively groggy after waking.\"\n\nResearch, including one 2015 study which looked at how naps could improve cognitive flexibility, have found that napping in early to mid-afternoon, while the body clock experiences a natural circadian dip, has the optimum restorative and energising benefits.\n\nThe best nap length is relatively brief at around 10 to 30 minutes. While measuring post-nap effects such as sleepiness, vigour, and cognitive performance, studies have found 10-minute naps to produce the best results, occurring immediately after waking up and lasting for as long as 155 minutes.\n\nIt can therefore be argued that these factors constitute the perfect nap according to science. This is based on the grounds that the purpose of the nap is both to combat tiredness and to re-invigorate the brain.\nhttps://patient.info/news-and-features/do-naps-count-as-getting-good-sleep\n\n3D-printed robot ant colonies work together to solve problems\nhttps://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/3d-printed-ant-robots-work-together-to-solve-problems\n\nCurrently, the team is conducting a 100-day check-out that has them testing satellite systems and subsystems and calibrating instruments.

It didn\u2019t always used to be like this\u2014and the growing presence and intensity of corporate sponsorships is worrying news, even for conferences where Big Oil is technically not allowed.\nhttps://gizmodo.com/the-fight-to-save-the-world-1848014829\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Surgery, found that the differences in referral volumes and types could not be explained by patients\u2019 choices or by characteristics of the surgeon, such as age or experience. The findings suggest that male physicians hold biases that disadvantage female surgeons, further widening the gender pay gap in medicine.\n\nResearchers at Unity Health Toronto and ICES compared the proportion of referrals made by male and female physicians to male and female surgeons over a ten year span from 1997 to 2016. Nearly 40 million referrals were made to 5,660 surgeons. Although male surgeons accounted for 77.5 per cent of all surgeons, they received 79 per cent of referrals sent by female physicians, but 87 per cent of referrals sent by male physicians.\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/934220\n\nThe team created maps of global temperature changes for every 200-year interval going back 24,000 years.\n\n\"These maps are really powerful,\" Osman said. \"With them, it's possible for anyone to explore how temperatures have changed across Earth, on a very personal level.

Research recently published in Stem Cell Reports\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933946\n\nHence the flurry of climate pledges that were made over the past year. They focus on what will be done by the end of the decade, by which time global greenhouse gas emissions must be roughly half what they were in 2010 in order to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. So far, no country is on track to do this, says Niklas H\u00f6hne of NewClimate Institute, a think-tank. Dr H\u00f6hne is part of a consortium of researchers called Climate Action Tracker, which plugs national climate policies and pledges into models in order to give an idea of how they translate into temperatures. The group\u2019s latest results (see chart), published on November 9th, say that if all 2030 decarbonisation plans were to be carried out as advertised but no further efforts were made, there would be a 68% chance that global average temperatures in 2100 would be between 1.9\u00b0C and 3.0\u00b0C warmer than pre-industrial times, with a median estimate of 2.4\u00b0C.\nhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/11/13/are-climate-goals-set-in-2015-dead-or-alive\n\nUp until exposure to 95 decibels of sound, the inner ear fluid level remained normal. However, researchers discovered that after exposure to 100 decibels\u2014which is equivalent to sounds such as a power lawn mower, chain saw or motorcycle\u2014mice developed inner ear fluid buildup within hours. A week after this exposure, the animals were found to have lost auditory nerve cells.\n\nHowever, when researchers applied hypertonic saline, a salt-based solution used to treat nasal congestions in humans, into affected ears one hour after the noise exposure, both the immediate fluid buildup and the long-term nerve damage lessened, implying that the hearing loss could be at least partially prevented.\n\nThese study results have several important implications, according to Oghalai, especially as the loss of nerve cells in the inner ear is known as \"hidden hearing loss\" because hearing tests are unable to detect the damage.\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-loud-noises-fluid-buildup-ear.html\n\nCompared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna\u2019s shot has led to only 10 additional cases of myocarditis per 100,000 inoculations among males age 12 to 29, Burton said.

The Department of the Interior will offer up more than 80 million acres \u2014 an area larger than the state of New Mexico \u2014 of the Gulf of Mexico for drilling. It is bigger than any lease sale conducted under President Donald Trump\u2019s fossil-fuel-friendly administration, and Interior estimates it will lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades.\n\nThe administration argues its hands are tied, following the June decision by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana to strike down Biden\u2019s executive order temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters.\n\n\u201cThe administration has made clear that it disagrees with the ruling and the Department of Justice has appealed it, but the government must comply with it in the meantime,\u201d White House spokesman Vedant Patel said in an email statement, noting that Interior previously canceled the pending lease sale.\n\nThe injunction stemmed from a lawsuit brought by 14 Republican attorneys against the administration. The judge\u2019s opinion relied in part on a study of the leasing pause\u2019s potential economic impacts, which an industry trade group helped shape and that multiple independent researchers dismissed.\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-climate-gulf-oil-lease-sale_n_618eeb77e4b0b1aee9252872\n\nwere prescribed an intermittent fasting schedule: twice a week water-only 24-hour fasting for four weeks, then once a week water-only 24 hour-fasting for 22 weeks. Fasts could not be done on consecutive days. The remaining 31 participants made no changes to their diet or lifestyle.\n\nAfter 26 weeks, researchers then measured participants\u2019 galectin-3, and found that it was higher in the intermittent fasting group. They also found lower rates of HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) and MSS (metabolic syndrome), which researchers believe may be similar to the reported effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, a class of drugs used to lower high glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients.\n\n\u201cIn finding higher levels of galectin-3 in patients who fasted, these results provide an interesting mechanism potentially involved in helping reduce the risk of heart failure and diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Horne, who added that a few members of the trial team completed the same regime before the study started to make sure that it was doable and not overly taxing to participants.\n\n\u201cUnlike some IF diet plans that are incredibly restrictive and promise magic weight loss, this isn\u2019t a drastic form of fasting. The best routine is one that patients can stick to over the long term, and this study shows that even occasional fasting can have positive health effects,\u201d he added.\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/934705", "Drove to this dealership for this car and saw this massive price difference online vs in-person.

OOP's nephews and nieces push people into the pool and eventually try with OOP. OOP sees this coming from a mile away and steps out of the way and the kids fall in, along with the phone they were holding to record. OOP's sisters got pissed for \"almost letting their kids drown\" and because the phone is now at the bottom of the pool. They insist that OOP should have let the kids push him into the pool and OOP needs to apologize.\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/15u2n72/update_aita_for_jumping_out_of_the_way_when_my/)**: August 17, 2023 (Almost 1 month later)**\n\nTLDR of first half of post:\n\nOOP spends the first part of this post explaining that the kids were fully capable of swimming and that the party ended on a sour note. Turns out drunk BIL who face-planted had to get stitches. Sisters and BILs texted mean shit to OOP and he and his wife blocked them. Mom and Dad were pissed at the texts and made the sisters apologize and 'end this nonsense.'\n\nOOP thought things were over but instead gets a text from one BIL saying OOP needs to reimburse them for the phone. OOP refuses, sends a screenshot to his parents and says he's going no-contact with sisters.\n\nIn what OOP says is an out of character move, Dad calls sisters and 'rips them a new one.' Grandkids are no longer welcome at their place indefinitely, which messes up the free babysitting Mom provides. They are banned from the vacation house and he tells them that OOP owns that vacation house, not the parents. Sisters freak out. Sisters and husbands come over unannounced to apologize a few days later- OOP and wife are out at dinner so they leave a note. OOP decides no contact is the best option for now.\n\n**Update 2** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/16266ru/update_2/)**: August 26, 2023 (9 days from previous post)**\n\n*(Editor's note- Just wanted to include this first line)* Well, it's been an interesting last few days. I thought the shit had hit the fan before but it was more of a fart compared to what's happened this week.\n\n**TLDR:** OOP provides financial context here: OOP's sisters think parents are dripping in money when in fact they are not. Turns out oldest sis and her fam have been living beyond their means and are in need of a loan (which parents can't give). She's also been renting out the vacation house once a month or so for the last 3 years and has been keeping the money. Other sister was aware of this and possibly has rented it out previously as well.\n\nOOP's parents feel awful and let OOP know. They figure that the sisters will try to convince OOP to let them rent out the house- turns out they're right. The sisters show up and practically force their way inside OOP's house to convince them to let them use the place. They also say (quoting from OOP here): \"I've been a shitty brother and that I needed to \"step up\" and plan on paying for their kids' college tuitions since \"that's what family does\".\" OOP calls them out on their bullshit and there's a huge blowup and the sisters leave. OOP is exhausted, frustrated and drained.\n\n**Update 3** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/16h06o1/update_3/)**: September 12, 2023 (2.5 weeks from last update)**\n\n**TLDR:** OOP's parents decide they're done managing the vacation home (keeping track of who was using it, routine maintenance, etc) because sisters keep pressuring them to use it. OOP feels bad for his parents because he wanted them to be able to use it regularly and now dynamics have changed, but he gets it.\n\nOOP locks the gate with a heavy duty chain and lock, resets all keypads and creates new codes, gets security cameras and has signs put up saying the area is monitored by video.\n\nOOP gets a call from both husbands trying to convince him to let them use the house \"like they always have.\" Oldest BIL tried to go up with some friends but couldn't get in. He threatens on the phone to basically break in and acts completely entitled. Other BIL sounds like he is being made to call by sister. OOP obviously says no and considers selling the home. He also has no plans to initiate contact with sisters and they are not talking with him.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/179pz3l/update_4/) **4:** **October 16, 2023 (1 month later)**\n\n**TLDR:** OOP hires a guy to manage/look after the vacation home. Parents are continually pressured by sisters to tell OOP to open up the vacation home for Thanksgiving. They refused and instead said they would organize a gathering at an Airbnb if everyone split the cost, otherwise they would host at their place. This causes and argument because middle sister is for the Airbnb, oldest sister doesn't have any money. So Thanksgiving will be at parents' house but OOP and wife won't be there.\n\nParents ask OOP to not sell for now as they would like to still use the place, but won't until sisters have come to terms with the \"new normal.\"\n\nWife and OOP have stayed no contact with sisters, but they have called and left messages (OOP says \"F you Google Voice\") demanding OOP meets with them and work out \"how everyone can use the 'family vacation home'.\" OOP doesn't respond. OOP also does not plan to turn the vacation home into an Airbnb.\n\n*This part is directly from the post:*\n\nMy parents tell me that the oldest sister and her husband are getting out of the leases for their SUV and big ass truck and are selling their jet skis and some other shit they've never needed. That's going to be really hard on her, she's quite the braggart and won't like being seen in something older / smaller / cheaper. My BIL's identity is very much wrapped up with his truck as well, he even has a small tattoo of the truck company's logo. Which frankly is one of the many reasons why he and I never hung out.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/185gom3/update_5_crap/) **5: November 27, 2023 (1.5 months later)**\n\n**Title:** Update #5... Crap.\n\nWrote most of this yesterday but decided to wait to post it until I wasn't so wound up. Waiting didn't work, I'm still wound up. Sorry if this rambles, so much has happened, hard to write coherently.\n\nThings have gone to hell. I really, truly did not think anything like this would happen.\n\nShort version: My brothers in law broke into my vacation home and were arrested. They've been charged with breaking and entering, destruction of property and communicating threats, all Class 1 misdemeanors. I've refused to drop the charges. I might do so if I'm fully paid for the damage they caused. They were still in jail as of Saturday evening, I assume they're out by now.\n\nThings had settled down, at least I thought so. Haven't seen or heard from my sisters in over six weeks. My parents went up to the house for a week and had a good time. David - the property manager I hired - has worked out great, he's done a couple of repairs I asked him to do and I've given him a list that he's going to work on. He usually sends a photo or two of wildlife or a sunset to his clients every week, was kind of making me want to get up there.\n\nFriday after Thanksgiving my BILs went to my vacation home. They used an angle grinder to cut through the chain on the driveway gate and damaged the gate in the process. They tried to get in through the front door, ruined the lockset and gouged the door badly. They finally got in through the utility floor door and a locked internal door. They also broke into the barn, I'm not sure why. When they went out through the front door where they were met by sheriff's deputies and David. David gets notifications from the camera system when there's activity, he saw what was going on and called the sheriff's department.\n\nAccording to David the BILs tried to bullshit their way out of it but the deputies didn't buy it. Breaking into an empty house is a pretty serious thing up there, usually it's meth heads who ransack the place and hock everything. When the BILs were arrested they freaked out big time, were saying how they were going to beat the hell out of me, etc... Not smart to do in front of cops.\n\nDavid and the sheriff's office tried calling my wife and me to see what we wanted to do but we were spending the day with her parents and had left our phones in the car so we could be in vacation mode. So they booked the BILs on everything, which is what I would have asked them to do anyway.\n\nBIL's called their wives from jail who of course freaked out; they called my folks, tried to call me (they're blocked), tried to find a lawyer up there to arrange bail (not easy to do given that it's a rural area and was a holiday weekend). Older sister has zero cash and her cards are maxxed out so if they made bail my middle sister would have had to pay for both husbands. I know they were still in jail as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe didn't check our phones until late Friday on the way home from the in laws. There were a ton of calls and messages from my mom, dad, David and the sheriff's department. Talk about ruining a great day, I was in such a good mood til I looked at my phone. My wife read through the texts and listened the messages, read them out to me and by the time we got home I had some idea of what was going on. I put my brain back into thinking mode, tried to get past my anger, failed. Called David and got the rundown on what had happened and how bad the damage was, resulting in more anger.\n\nI ended Friday by calling the sheriff's department and telling them there was no misunderstanding, the BILs had absolutely no right to be on my property and I wanted to press charges. I didn't call my folks back. Barely slept.\n\nI waited until Saturday afternoon to call my folks. They were both pretty rattled about it all, my mom in particular. My sisters had browbeat them into telling me I should tell the cops it was all a mistake and that I wanted the charges dropped. I refused flat out, told them there was no way I'd do that until I spoke with an attorney and also not until I was paid in full for whatever it will cost to fix everything 100%. My mom was crying hard by the time we got off the phone which of course made me feel like shit. My dad suggested it was time for a complete start over but also said he thought they needed to pay for the damage.\n\nI haven't gone up to the property yet. There's nothing I can do and I'll probably go nuts when I see the damage in person, the photos are bad enough. I'm hoping to tomorrow or Wednesday but my job isn't one I can just wander off from for non-emergencies.\n\nI've left messages with two attorney friends asking them to recommend the right lawyer(s) to go after my sisters and BILs. I don't know what I can do exactly but I'm hoping to get restraining orders (I have all the texts they've sent me, that might help). I'm strongly considering suing them for the money they made renting the place, I don't care about the cash but it will help make them as miserable as possible. The gloves are definitely off at this point.\n\nA couple of side notes:\n\n* BILs had no idea I'd hired someone to keep an eye on things or that there are cameras there now. My parents knew but hadn't told them because they knew it would just give my sisters a reason to drama up. There are signs on the property stating it's being monitored with cameras and no trespassing signs though.\n* My wife has completely had it at this point. I don't blame her, she's been more than patient about it all but she reached her limit and was not shy about letting me know. She told me its up to me how I deal with this but that she thought they all needed to be taught a hard lesson.\n* Older BIL likely won't face any repercussions at his job over this but middle BIL has a security clearance so he might. I'm hoping that will be motivation for middle BIL to pay for the damages himself immediately.\n* David (the caretaker) has an interesting background. I knew he was friends with some of the deputies, figured it was because they were all locals. I was wrong, he was a cop in a big city for years, was shot on duty and afterwards decided to quit and move to where his parents had retired. He has some PTSD over it all, his dog is a certified service animal and is usually with him. I know law enforcement people tend to hang together, I guess that's how they became his friend group.\n* I don't want to see or speak with these Aholes for the rest of my life. I know this is in direct conflict with my overwhelming urge to make their lives as miserable as possible.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/189aece/update_6/) **6: December 2, 2023 (5 days later)**\n\nDidn't think I'd be doing another post this soon but a lot has happened over the past two days. Short version: I think the corner has been turned on this crap.\n\nThursday afternoon I got a courier-delivered envelope at my office. In it was a signed letter from both my brothers-in-law and a cashier's check for $5000. In the letter they made what I have to say was a really sincere apology. Among other things they acknowledged breaking in, acknowledged it was wrong, said the $5000 was to pay for the damage and that they'd pay more if it cost more than that. Also said they'd stay away from the vacation home unless my wife and I specifically invited them. They also asked that I do what could to get the charges dropped as soon as possible because they both could lose their jobs and that they'd agree to a restraining order or whatever else it took for that to happen. There was more as well, all conciliatory, but that's the gist of it.\n\nTo say this was a shock is an understatement. It was (obviously) a total 180 from their past behavior.\n\nI'd already made an appointment with an attorney to see about suing my BILs over the damage and to try to get a restraining order. I called him and told him what I'd just received and he agreed to meet with me at the end of the day instead of next week. Told me not to deposit the check.\n\nWe met for about two hours. He ended up recommending the wife and I do a \"settlement and mutual release agreement\" with all four of them (sisters and BILs). He said if we went after them via a lawsuit that we'd almost certainly win but that it could take two years or more, there would be sizeable up front legal fees and that we might never see any money. He also said we could keep the $5000 free and clear even if we didn't let them off the hook. He's drawing up the agreement, it won't be ready until Monday. The agreement will include what's essentially the civil equivalent of a restraining order.\n\nI'd already asked my property manager to work up a bid to get the damage repaired. I called him after the meeting and asked that he get me as close an estimate as possible ASAP. Got that Friday, he thinks it will take around $4000 to fix everything. Most of that is for the front door.\n\nOn Friday my attorney contacted each of the BILs, told them what we were proposing and advised them to get their own lawyers. They both agreed to it. The middle BIL told him they could afford to either pay for the damages or pay for a lawyer but not both and they figured a lawyer wouldn't make any difference given that they really had no defense for what they did. His biggest concern was if the charges could be dropped. From what I can tell they're willing to do anything / sign anything to make this all go away.\n\nMy attorney also called the DA's office on Friday to discuss dismissing the charges, got the name of the prosecutor and left them a message but has not spoken to them yet. He thinks they'll dismiss the charges because the BILs are paying up and they have no priors, but then again he's not a criminal lawyer. Also said I should be prepared to drive up there Monday or Tuesday and tell the prosecutor in person that I want everything dismissed.\n\nHe's also advised me to continue to be no contact with sisters and BILs especially for the next six months and that it will be really important to follow the terms of the agreement when it comes to future interactions with them.\n\nI'm guessing that the BILs change of heart is due to them having figured out what's at stake for them, what it's going to cost them in legal fees and fines and so on. There's also the (highly unlikely) possibility that they could go to jail for up to 120 days, and as I've mentioned one of them has a security clearance for his job that could be at risk. So this is their Hail Mary pass to keep their normal lives.\n\nThis isn't a perfect resolution to the situation, but at least it will get me past the legal and financial parts of the shit show that I've been in for the past few months. I doubt I'll ever have a civil relationship with any of them ever again and that's fine. What I want most at this point is to close this off, get on with my life and never speak to any of them again. I'm exhausted from this. Wife feels pretty much the same way.\n\nKind of a side issue but getting the written apology was, weirdly, a huge moment for me. I wasn't expecting that ever but apparently it matters to me quite a bit. The money doesn't feel particularly important at this moment. I'll damn sure take it though.\n\nAlso I'm pretty certain my middle sister and her husband came up with the money. The cashier's check is from the credit union of the company he works for.\n\nOnce things are signed I plan to make one more update, probably just an edit to this post.\n\nI'm sorry for being so pedantic. Writing these posts has helped clear my head and the feedback has really helped. I truly appreciate everyone's comments, insights, and support. And I really, really hope none of you ever have to go this kind of nonsense.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/18czdxf/update_7_final_i_hope/) **7: December 7, 2023 (5 days later)**\n\nTuesday morning I met with my attorney went over the agreement. Changed a couple of minor things and he sent it to my sisters and brothers-in-law. It included a requirement that they pay my attorney's fee (about $3000). They weren't happy about that and tried to negotiate it away, but he told them they either accept it as is or there would be no deal at all and we'd proceed with suing them for the money they got from renting out the place, wear and tear from renting it, repair costs from their break in, emotional distress, lost income from having to deal with this, attorney fees and whatever else we could. He also told them I would push hard with the DA's office to prosecute every charge.\n\nShort version, they came in and signed. I wasn't there. I'm told it was a pretty tense environment, that the middle BIL appeared to have taken charge and that at one point he told both of my sisters to shut the hell up or he was walking away from the whole thing, making his own deal with us and the rest of them could all go to hell. They provided another cashier's check for $2500, claimed that's all they had. It's close enough that we're going to accept it as the final payment.\n\nAttorney also told me that everyone was very cold and curt towards one another, but that they all managed to keep it together long enough to sign and left without making too big of a scene.\n\nI drove up to the vacation house early yesterday to check out the damage and meet with the DA's office. Seeing the damage made my blood boil, it was so senseless. I was so pissed that I was ready to eat the cost of repairs and do everything I could to ruin their lives. Tried walking it off, failed utterly. Ended up calling a good friend who was kind enough to stay on the phone for over an hour letting me spew and vent. He eventually got me back to focusing on the bigger picture of putting this behind me and getting on with my life. Honestly I'm still not sure that's what I want to do but I settled down enough to get some food in me and I felt better.\n\nAfter lunch I went he DA's office. Hadn't made an appointment and had to wait a while but got to meet with the assistant DA who's got the case. Short version is that since I don't want to prosecute and the BILs have already paid for the damages that they are willing to drop all the charges except trespassing, which in this case will be a class 2 misdemeanor. The BILs will have to plead guilty and pay whatever fine the judge sets. I'm also told that if they fight the trespassing charge or ever so much as fart in public up there that it would go very poorly for them. It helped that the BILs didn't resist arrest, if they had none of the charges would have been dropped.\n\nI also went by the sheriff's office to thank them for getting there so quickly and everything. Wanted to thank the deputies personally but only spoke to the dispatch person. And I tried to meet up with David (the property manager) but couldn't get hold of him.\n\nA couple of notes: The agreement includes a no contact clause. Basically if any of them show up where my wife or I are (or the other way around) whoever got there last has to leave immediately. No contact except through attorneys or other \"mutually agreed upon third parties\". They get to keep whatever they made from renting the vacation house (my big \"give\") unless I have tax consequences which they will be responsible for. And we release each other from all other liabilities up through the present. There's more to it than that but those are the high points.\n\nWife and I will sign the agreement later today. After that I can't talk about most of this but I can talk around it.\n\nI think this is my final update regarding all this nonsense but I'll respond to comments if I can. As I've said before, posting about all of this and reading folks thoughts and responses has been really helpful and has probably been key in my being able to handle this in a relatively healthy way. So thank you all again.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Weakness-6250/comments/1bgbonr/march_2024_oldest_sister_bil_have_filed_for/)**: March 16, 2024 (3.5 months later, 8 months from OG post)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Title:** March 2024 - Oldest sister & BIL have filed for bankruptcy\n\nThought it would be worth an update for anyone who's interested.\n\nUnsurprisingly my oldest sister and brother in law have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. While I don't care about what happens to them financially or otherwise they've also managed to drag my parents into their mess, which I'm not happy about.\n\nAt the start of the year my BIL's oversized-customized-pride-and-joy truck was repossessed. Pretty embarrassing for him I'm sure, happened at work. This was their breaking point, without the truck they have to share a Kia my parents loaned them and they can barely fit in it with their three kids. Financially they're f'd. They owe at least $125K (probably more) on high interest credit cards, they have zero equity in their house, and have a couple of personal loans that I'm pretty certain they got under false pretenses. They have loans on their jet skis, ATVs and trailers. They also owe a chunk of money from defaulting on the truck lease.\n\nThey hadn't made any payments on their credit cards or loans in months and were behind on their house payments as well. They got out of the lease on my sister's massive SUV late last year. They were upside down on it as well so had to come up with cash to do so. They also had to pay an attorney, the fine and court costs for my BIL's trespassing charge at the vacation house. And they owe my middle sister and her husband money for bail and their portion of the damages to the place.\n\nAs I've mentioned before my folks have never been financial wizards, but they have at least been generally responsible. They're retired, their home is paid off and they live off of social security and pensions. Altogether they get more than they spend. Minimal savings, just an emergency fund. Turns out my folks emptied out that fund, cashed out their small IRA (\\~$20K) and gave it to my sister. That let her catch up on the house payment and cover the negative equity on her car lease. But now literally every bit of savings my parents possessed is gone. Plus my parents have been paying for their groceries for several months and continue to pay the insurance on the car they loaned my sister.\n\nAccording to my dad my sisters worked my mom for weeks to get her to fork over the money. They'd worked on both my folks at the same time for a while but my dad flat out refused every time. Eventually mom caved, she was worried that my sister would have to move to a hovel in some backwater town and that the kids would be barefoot and eating dirt. Dad's not happy about it, and to say there's some tension between them right now is an understatement. But they'll be fine.\n\nI was pretty disappointed when my parents told me all this but I wasn't surprised. It sucks that that they emptied out their savings to help but I kind of get it, the way the bankruptcy laws are in our state by getting caught up on the home loan my sister should be able to keep the house. I tried hard not to say how I felt about this and my sisters, mostly succeeded. Really I'm way more pissed about this than I should be.\n\nThe worst part for me is that my sister and BIL could now contact me and my wife without any real fear of repercussions. The only penalty the no contact agreement has is that if they violate it we can go after them for the money they made from renting out the vacation house and related damages. Since they've filed for bankruptcy that's now not an impediment for them. I'm hoping they'll leave us alone but who knows.\n\nFolks also told me that my middle sister and her husband have \"hit a rough spot\" and that he's not currently living with her and the kids. Just a guess but I imagine he's had it with the whole family dynamic that caused this nonsense.\n\nNot directly related, but on a brighter note I've spent two weekends at the mountain house since the start of the year, once with my wife and once alone. Both times there was a lot of snow. It was incredibly beautiful and relaxing. Very therapeutic. The place also has good Internet service now (thanks Starlink) which is nice. Plus knowing that I can count on David (the property manager) to keep the place in shape / ready for us to visit and to help if we get snowed in eliminates most of the stress in owning it. My folks have used it a few times as well and get along great with David.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Could you get a restraining order?*\n\nIf they start up again I do indeed plan to get a restraining order. In fact my wife made it clear to me she expects a very hard approach to any BS from them going forward - which I agree with of course.\n\nI had the security cameras at our house upgraded at the start of the year just in case they come by. I also kept all their previous texts and provided screenshots to my attorney for safekeeping.\n\nIf they cause any trouble at the vacation house they're toast, the sheriff's department and DA's office have the full story and are sympathetic to our situation.\n\n*If they lose their home, they may demand to live in the mountain house or with your parents:*\n\nThankfully my folks live in an over 55 community so they can't move in there. Plus the house is not anywhere near large enough for seven people unless everybody stays in the \"great room\" all the time. And God knows where they'd park.\n\nLiving in the vacation house isn't practical for them either, again something I'm happy about. With traffic it's probably three hours from there to my BIL's job. They'd have to have 4WD vehicles to live there year round too. Plus from what I understand the schools there are not very good (I'm being polite), and as much as I dislike my sister I'll say that she's all in on keeping her kids in good schools.\n\nThey can afford their current house once they get through bankruptcy, assuming they change how they spend. I think they'll have to, no one in their right mind would lend them money or give them a credit card. The won't be able to take fancy vacations or swap out his truck every couple of years for an even bigger one (yeah, I admit, that goddamn truck fetish of his really bugs me) but they'll live just fine. It's not like a family of five is going to suffer when they're taking in close to $200K per year.\n\nHopefully I'm not being Pollyannaish about all this.\n\n*They should have sold the truck and other things MONTHS ago:*\n\nTo be fair (and this is according to my parents) they tried to sell the ATVs and watercraft. But the value on those things drop like a rock the moment you buy them and they were upside down on the loans. So they eventually just quit paying on them.\n\nAlso this reminds me - when they broke into the vacation house they also broke into the mini barn. Turns out my older BIL had stowed his two ATVs in it. Just guessing but I think he was going to take them, report them stolen, get an insurance settlement and sell them on the sly.\n\n(I found out in January that the ATVs were there and paid to have them taken to my dad's place; he had my BIL pick them up from there.)\n\nAlso, I don't think my BIL was expecting the truck to repo'd. I think he was working to catch up on the payments so they'd have one good vehicle. The finance company must have just run out of patience. Don't blame them, he's a fuck up.\n\nCommenter: They must have been making quite a packet from their fraudulent vacation home income for it to impact their finances to this extent.\n\n>**OOP:** I think they were grossing at least $50K per year, probably more. Tax free, it was never listed on Airbnb as far as I can tell, they'd rent to friends, friends of friends, etc.  \n>  \n>I base the $50K on the fact that my parents kept a calendar for the house to keep track of who was using the place. I went through the last three years worth of calendars and my sisters were using the place a lot, sometimes for a week at a time. Supposedly they were doing school related planning retreats as well as just family time. I know similar places go for $2000 (or more) per weekend and at least $4000 for a week. It can sleep 6 people in bedrooms and has a bunk room for kids that all 5 would stay in. Plus it has two queen size pull out sofas. If you pushed it you could fit more people than that.  \n>  \n>I think my sisters are just spendaholics. They constantly have the newest whatever - iPads, TVs, clothes, diets, you name it. So no matter how much they got they'd spend more. So this was going to happen eventually.\n\n*$125,000 on CREDIT CARDS????*\n\n$125K is my estimate based on my sister telling my parents they were racking up least $3000 per month just in credit card interest. She thought it might be more. Their credit was already crap before the bankruptcy so I'm guessing they might be paying as high as 28% interest. If so they'd owe about $125K. If they're paying a lower interest rate the principal would be higher.\n\nBut yeah, it's an absurd amount. And that $3000 doesn't include all the other interest they're paying. And of course there's the principal that just sits there.\n\nOn the other hand I'm told they had a great time going to Disney World for a week so there's that.\n\n*If your parents ask you for money, make sure to make them sign something:*\n\nSince all this started I've given a fair amount of thought regarding my parents and their possible (likely) need for money in the future. I've come up with an approach that I think will work for me. It's a bit mercantile but it's the best way I've come up with.\n\nIf and when my parents need money I'm going to do a formal loan secured by their home. Basically it will be a private HELOC (home equity line of credit) at market interest rate. They can pay it back or not but when they go to sell the house or die I'll be first in line to get paid, with interest. This means they can waste it on my sisters if they choose to but at the end it will come out of the sisters' share of the house.\n\nI'll end up paying for my folks end of life care after they run out of money / equity in their house regardless of course. It's not like my siblings will contribute.\n\n*Middle BIL:*\n\nYounger BIL seems to be more decent than I've given him credit for in the past. I'll admit to a bit of myopia, for years I've seen the four of them and their kids as just one mass of inconvenient people I have nothing in common with but can't avoid. But he seems to have hit his limit and made some changes. Hope it works out for him and that he pulls my sister in the right direction.\n\n*How sisters got so entitled:*\n\nMy sisters (and I) weren't raised to be like they are. When I was young they weren't any more self entitled than any other teenagers. We all worked crappy teenage jobs, didn't get spoiled, it was really a very standard suburban upbringing. We weren't super close but we weren't enemies.\n\nSomewhere along the line after going off to college they changed for the worse. I guess it could be worse, they could have become drug addicts or militant vegan volcano worshippers or whatever. But they sure became people I don't want to be around.\n\nAnd yes, the pool incident was the spark for the meltdown but the fuel had been accumulating for years. It would have come out at some point that she was renting the house out on the sly and things would have gone to hell then just like they did now.", "YSK that if you drive a newer Honda or Kia - they are the worst offenders when it comes to sharing your driving habits with Insurance companies and that if your insurance went up a lot recently you can join a class action lawsuit.

You can still make money \u2013 big money \u2013 by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I\u2019m about to tell you.

SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.\n* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business\u2014Amelia.

Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \\~$44.7M.\u00a0\n\n[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)\n\nWe don\u2019t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn\u2019t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you\u2019re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it\u2019s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \\~$22M (50% \\* $44.7M).\u00a0\n\nSince the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \\~58% of Amelia\u2019s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \\* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.**\u00a0\n\nBacking this out of Soundhound\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \\~$12M, declining \\~9% year-over-year.**\n\n[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)\n\nHonestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can\u2019t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn\u2019t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it\u2019s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn\u2019t - you\u2019re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it\u2019s wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!**\u00a0\n\nEven worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn\u2019t a growth story; it\u2019s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.\n\n[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)\n\nWhen I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don\u2019t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.**\u00a0\n\n[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.\u00a0\n\n# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue\n\nAmelia, the acquisition that accounts for this \u201cgrowth,\u201d is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia\u2019s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia\u2019s \u201cconversational AI\u201d is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you\u2019ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here\u2019s how my conversation went:\u00a0\n\n[Amelia Chat](https://preview.redd.it/r5ujc4en6v5e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb43d5aff2e3d3fb7da62ce343c93c9c2574cd12)\n\nNothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn\u2019t answer basic questions like \u201cWhat are some things you can help me with?\u201d. **This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.**\u00a0\n\nContrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai [website ](https://olukai.com/pages/contact)and clicking \u201cContact Us\u201d. Here\u2019s how my conversation went:\u00a0\n\n[Sierra chat](https://preview.redd.it/b7txd7lq6v5e1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=088bfe0c601b8be9afd42b1acb3d6c2ecd3430e6)\n\nThe difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn\u2019t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there\u2019s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.\u00a0\n\nNone of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.\u00a0\n\nBut, let\u2019s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, **why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations?** That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.\u00a0\n\nNone of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn\u2019t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it\u2019s also \\~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound\u2019s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here\u2019s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icz23hx07v5e1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6f256e0975d1efcbd30088077176ed268f551\n\nIn 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of \\~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound\u2019s revenue, good or bad. And I think it\u2019s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. **Amelia\u2019s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!**\u00a0\n\nSeriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia\u2019s margins are so terrible is because **they don\u2019t sell very much software**, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here\u2019s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:\u00a0\n\n[Amelia revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/hfmpse697v5e1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8347bb1b070988f4e2b28a5fc51760fa07978b9c)\n\nThe vast majority of revenue came from \u201cSubscription\u201d, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. **The reason they\u2019re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report,** so they\u2019ve combined it with services and called the whole thing \u201cSubscription\u201d.\u00a0\n\nObviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia\u2019s gross margin of 30%.\u00a0\n\n# Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk\n\nSoundhound isn\u2019t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.\u00a0\n\nAdding to the problem is customer concentration: **62% of Soundhound\u2019s revenue comes from just two automotive customers**, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound\u2019s revenue will crater.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwhmohjk7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=684e25adcd9bcb7a1aa1d565549e32196a4c429e\n\nWorse, only 15% of Soundhound\u2019s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound\u2019s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, **Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgvxxjan7v5e1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3483c49c95c31b3f348a3f0a1f8f49bd1f87d5\n\n# The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO\n\nIf you\u2019ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cBut what about Nvidia!\u201d And sure, Nvidia\u2019s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here\u2019s the cold, hard truth: this \u201cpartnership\u201d is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.\n\nYes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound \u2013 just 1.7M common shares \u2013 but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a [private $75M venture round](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75m-to-bring-its-voice-enabled-ai-everywhere/), long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound\u2019s [2021 de-SPAC process](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390021059758/ea150505ex99-2_archimedes.htm), yet retail investors and media only took notice when [Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000021/xslForm13F_X02/information_table.xml) report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o6rpulq7v5e1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=224e650fcb4281072d203301362e0f74fdb2a786\n\nPrior to this, the **one and only time** NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound\u2019s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 \u201cstrategic\u201d investors, NVIDIA among them:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0y6gvezt7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=379365fe89c9d7410816d3ea0dc662c10d27180e\n\nJust one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/) about its integration with Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, **Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times**, describing the \u201ccollaboration\u201d as a \u201cvery big milestone\u201d for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the \u201cpartnership\u201d as new, **Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023** based on a trip to the Wayback machine\n\n[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023](https://preview.redd.it/4toe71qx7v5e1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596eeddf44e08e19aaf7dd7c321a3d886ad4ea1)\n\nBut let\u2019s examine the facts. [Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/) is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It\u2019s not an exclusive club. Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, **including Soundhound\u2019s closest competitor** (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a [blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cerence-generative-ai-in-car-experience/) showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done for Soundhound. **If this \u201cpartnership\u201d were truly transformative, wouldn\u2019t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?**\n\n[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current \\(Cerence\\)](https://preview.redd.it/c0iczsy28v5e1.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a889071b541ebc556505e51c7e2a5b0ec9e2ec)\n\nThe reality is, Soundhound\u2019s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn\u2019t a deep, strategic relationship \u2013 it\u2019s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn\u2019t move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**\n\nThis isn\u2019t a transformative partnership; it\u2019s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it\u2019s worth. Don\u2019t fall for the hype.\n\n# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)\n\nIn its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as \u201c$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia\u2019s debt, as well as future earnout potential\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with this statement, it\u2019s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn\u2019t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64\n\nThe details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here\u2019s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)\n\nThis price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound\u2019s selective disclosure of Amelia\u2019s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.\n\n# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards\n\nI won\u2019t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there\u2019s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound\n\nSoundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that\u2019s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).\u00a0\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that\u2019s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.\u00a0\n\nWith this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.\n\nFor comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you\u2019re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir\u2019s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you\u2019re getting boomer-tech that\u2019s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezd0vkee8v5e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=85fee8310201e48ade789c1225c5e79c7f23aa58", "KiaMei kiss [Honkai impact 3rd] ", "My 100x companies \ud83e\udd1c\ud83d\udcc8 First off, for a company to potentially 100x, it has to be truly revolutionary to the point where no one believes in it. And that is what I love. I have mentioned a few of these in previous posts (my largest being IONQ) and got shit on for it. Since that post, it has doubled (177 days). Whether you agree or not, this post is mostly a way for me to combine my research and give others opportunities. Remember you can only lose 100% but make infinite.\u00a0I don\u2019t expect anyone to believe in these stocks now, but check back in 5 years. \n\n\n\nSo with that,\u00a0\n\n\n\nCompany number 1: **IONQ**. (I have made this post before but my confidence is so strong in IONQ that others need to hear it again)\n\n\n\nIONQ is a company in the quantum computing industry and the reason I\u2019m bullish on it is due to its positioning in the quantum industry. Unlike other companies such as IBM, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN and others, IONQ is able to create incredibly accurate qubits.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat is quantum computing and qubits?\n\n\n\nQuantum computing utilizes qubits rather than the conventional bits in computing to solve the most complex problems. A bit is the binary value of 1 or 0 that stores data. Qubits by themselves are not interesting but that data it holds can be held in a state of superposition. This allows the qubit to be in a way, in every possible form. Once groups of these are in superposition, that data is in multidimensional space. That may sound complicated but imagine a normal computer has its bits in 2d space whereas quantum computing pushes that to the 3rd or 4th dimension allowing the data to be in every configuration. That\u2019s just a basic quantum computer. Now to actually use these computers and qubits to solve complex problems, you must fire microwaves photons at them. The photons essentially tell it what position to be in. To change shape and read the info from that new position.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat does IONQ do that\u2019s special?\n\n\n\nWell IONQ has made incredibly accurate and stable qubits. Nature has created natural quantum systems in atoms that IONQ has been able to ionize and isolate. Because of that IONQ uses the naturally occurring quantum systems to create their qubits.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOther companies such as IBM have revolutionized other areas of computing. IBM has used their chips to improve error correction of output data. GOOG is maximizing the number of qubits. AMZN also focused on error correction and the overall accuracy of its computing. MSFT focuses on quantum algorithms. Basically no other company has been able to produce and scale accurate qubits. (This is different than IBM because IBM needs the tech to limit errors whereas IONQ\u2019s qubits practically have no errors to begin with)\n\n\n\nWhy quantum computing could be the future.\n\n\n\n1: Quantum computing has the potential to simply solve exponentially more challenging problems at a much faster rate. This will be used in our everyday life from shipping routes to electric vehicle batteries development. Any problem can be solved quicker and more accurately. \u00a0\n\n2: Quantum computing currently sits at an industry value of around 600 million with expectation for 9 billion in 2030. That\u2019s the compounded annual growth so a breakthrough could yield a much higher potential industry value\n\n3: IONQ has investors including Kia, Google, Fidelity, Hyundai, and a couple firms. As well as being partnered with Amazon. Its investors stemming from automobiles to banking shows the belief in the possibilities of quantum computing.\u00a0\n\n4: Quantum computers are just cool. They sound cool, they look cool, and who doesn\u2019t love cool. If you haven\u2019t seen one I highly recommend looking it up.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany number 2: **NuScale Power Corp (SMR)**\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe are just beginning to understand and even implement the extensive uses of nuclear energy. We are reaching undeniably dangerous levels of climate change due to constant greenhouse emissions due to growing populations, economies, and countries. Now these emissions come from producing out necessities which first stem from energy. Energy is everything. Everyone knows fossil fuels are simply bad for the environment but to what extent? Well to the extent that if we want humankind to live over 50 more years, we NEED to limit these emissions. And that is where nuclear energy comes in. Nuclear energy releases nearly zero emissions yet is roughly 8000 times more efficient than fossil fuels. So that begs the question, why don\u2019t we solely use nuclear energy? It was unstable and unfeasible to main stream it. Until now.\n\n\n\nSMR is in the works of finalizing and streamlining its small modular reactors. Previously power plants required large plots of land, large mantience crews, and came with high risks of meltdown and the effects that come with that. However, SMR has cut down every single one of those factors.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow why would you invest in futuristic nuclear fission without understanding it. Well here is is simply put if you have taken a high school chemistry course. A neutron is released into a stable collection of uranium atoms which when collide and produce extreme amounts of energy taking the form of heat. Once one uranium atom splits, it releases more neutrons creating a chain reaction. This heat is then pressurized into steam which is used to create power. Now SMR submerges their reactors in water to provide consistent coolant during the reaction further within a room lined with seismic category 1 aircraft impact resistant structures. Now they also employ many more safety protocols to minimize the chance of a nuclear meltdown and the reaction of that to nearly zero.\n\n\n\nSo, why is nuclear energy and SMR simply creating the future?\n\n\n\n1: We will NEED nuclear energy if we want to continue to grow as a species without killing the climate and ourself\n\n2: SMR has innovated a way to scale nuclear power plants to make them economically viable for everyone and for our main supplier of power.\u00a0\n\n3: SMR has large investors including Google, Amazon, potentially Microsoft, and I\u2019m sure many more (no other investors were public information).\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso, a similar stock to SMR that I\u2019m also investing in is OKLO. They are similar to SMR just appear to be in the earlier stages of entering the nuclear energy market (which I love).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany number 3: **AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)**\n\n\n\nIm sure you have heard of ASTS through this subreddit, and probably think you already missed your chance ton invest. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u00a0\n\n\n\nASTS is a company building the first ever global cellular network in space that allows 4G/5G connection from anywhere in the world, with any cellular phone. How awesome does that sound. 5G coverage while at sea, in a plane, in the middle of the andes. Anywhere you could think, boom connection. Now their stock is up a ton recently for only having launched 5 satellites.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOnce again cellular coverage can be a complicated concept for some, so here it is simply put. As of now, with whoever your cellar provider is, (AT&T, Verizon, TMobile) Im sure you lose coverage while driving in the middle of nowhere, on flights, and sometimes in populated areas you would never expect. And it\u2019s only when you need connection that you realize you have no connection. So ASTS would fully eliminate this problem for anyone in the WORLD that owns a cellular phone and is connected with ASTS. The cellular market value sits at around 450 billion dollars. That\u2019s 450,000,000,000. Nearly completely devastated if ASTS can do what it says.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat being said, them being able to provide coverage anywhere in the world is a long shot. But that\u2019s why I love it. They have already received FCC permission to complete the launch of 5 satellite which turned out successful. With their hefty goal in mind that would take over an entire sector, they have a bright road ahead of them all mapped out, just waiting for asphalt.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, why is ASTS the future?\n\n\n\n1: They can provide cellular coverage ANYWHERE in the world from ANY cellular phone. And we already know how reliant our world is on electronics\n\n2: They have successfully launched 5 satellites and in the works of creating their arsenal in space\n\n3: If they are successful, they would take over a nearly 450 billion dollar sector and own a monopoly on cellular coverage.\u00a0\n\n4: they have strong investors including they major partner AT&T, Google, Vodafone, and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo anyways, that\u2019s just my two sense of stocks I see making people fortunes. But I\u2019m just a teenager with no degree in quantum computing, nuclear fusion, or cellular communications so take it with a grain of salt.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPositions: Nearly 16k spread throughout these 3 companies and constantly increasing.\n\n\n\nTl;dr: buy stocks, hold, make money", "Today marks the 9th anniversary of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!", "KiaMei [Honkai impact 3rd] ", "I used to defend the Kia Stinger adamantly, but the Kia dealers have worn me down. Hey all, it's no surprise that the Kia dealership experience isn't that great, we've seen plenty of posts since the Stinger's release but I do want to share my story because I do believe now that Kia dealers are definitely impacting the success of the Stinger.\n\nI believed in the Stinger from the moment it was announced. I considered it as a car plenty of times when deciding what the next car I buy should be. I knew the dealers weren't great but who cares, just buy the car and ignore the dealers. However, this is my story:\n\nCouple of years ago we went to check out a Stinger GT1 for my now wife, I loved the car then, the car drove and felt great. However, the Kia dealer was quite sexist, only talking to me even though I was redirecting the salesmen over to my wife. My wife took huge offense and we walked away, they were rude to the last minute. My wife ended up with a Civic Type R. I continued to defend the Stinger any chance I got \"yeah its a Kia but for that price point the car is amazing for what you get. It's a very well designed and built car.\"\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago, a dealer with 2022 Stingers on the lot had a 2021 Stinger as well. We go check it out, the 2021 Stinger has front bumper scratches/damage which happened when the dealer was taking delivery of the vehicle. Test drove the car, still the same amazing car. Being a GT2, the MSRP was about $52k, but hey with 2022s in the lot and the car being damaged, bound to get some more comfortable numbers I thought. Kia salesmen come back with $56k OTD price. \"I can't give you a better deal because I have to use that money to fix the car\" they say. I'm sorry what? I understand that its a crazy market but how do I have to pay for your system's screw up and damaging the car? Isn't this why there's insurances and what not? I walked away, I wasn't paying MSRP numbers for a 2021 when there are 2022s on the lot already. So then I take interest in another dealer as they have several 2022 Stingers on the lot, I begin to check out a 2022 GT1 Stinger (MSRP \\~$45k). I actually really liked it felt that I didn't need the higher priced model and was willing to pay MSRP for it given the state of the market. The dealer comes back with a $10k markup for a $56k OTD price for a non-special edition Kia Stinger of an MSRP of $45k. \"There's a huge shortage of chips/cars\" he says. There's a full lot of cars in this dealer and about 5 Stingers which is usually an average number of Stingers per dealers in my area but you're telling me you got a shortage? Again, understanding the market is crazy I was willing to pay MSRP and not try to haggle or anything like that. Just walked out again. Mind you, both dealers I had to engage with typical smug car salesmen, although to be fair also engaged with down to earth salesmen so I'd give them that (last two weeks I mean, they were plenty sexists and smug in 2019 when we were shopping for my wife).\n\nI told myself that I would just keep waiting until things calmed down a bit, more inventory, perhaps give a 3rd Kia dealer a try, etc. However, these experiences had left such a sour taste I kept thinking that I loved the Stinger but hated that it was a Kia, not the brand, the dealers and the people I had to interact with if I were to buy this car. My wife and I had dreamed about owning an Audi SQ5 (MSRP of $70k) as our family car, I ran the numbers and found that we could swing it. SQ5 is in limited inventory in my area, and there was a dealer 1 hour away with an SQ5 loaded with the things we wanted, so we did the drive. This being the second Audi I would own, I knew the dealership experience was not going to be comparable to Kia but it was going to come down to the numbers. If they had a mark up I wouldn't pull the trigger. What do you know, the Audi salesman says \"nope no mark ups, you would just pay MSRP, I'm sorry we can't give you a better deal because this specific model is highly sought out\". Long story short we bought the SQ5 for MSRP, a car that had MUCH more limited inventory in my state than the Stinger and Kia once again lost out on a Stinger customer.\n\nAfter this experience I'm done with Kia, not defending the Stinger anymore, will just assume that car doesn't exist. It's a shame really, because it really is a great car but its chances are being severely limited by the dealer network. Oh yeah, I should mention that its been about 2 weeks and all those Stingers I mentioned here are still on the dealerships' lot.", "\u201cIf something happens to us, we were murdered\u201d: Who killed Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner? Kylen Schulte (24) was depressed and recovering from an abusive relationship when her father Sean-Paul convinced her to move with him from Montana to Moab, Utah in 2019. She later credited this move with saving her life. Kylen\u2019s aunt Bridget Calvert describes Kylen as \u201ca true free spirit that lived for the joy in her heart, not the hatred in the world\u201d but Kylen\u2019s life had already been marred by tragedy. In 2015, her 15-year-old brother Mackeon \u2018Mackey\u2019 Schulte was accidentally shot to death in Billings, Montana by his close friend Seth Culver, 17. Around 2.30am on May 15, Mackeon knocked on Culver's bedroom window, trying to wake him. Culver panicked and fired a single shot through the window. The death was judged to be a \u2018justifiable homicide'. The Schulte family supported their son's killer, who was said to be devastated. Schulte\u2019s mother Valerie said the shooting was clearly an accident. \u201cYou can\u2019t let your emotions get away from what\u2019s prudent and lawful\". Kylen's father Sean-Paul hugged Culver at Mackeon\u2019s funeral and sent him a message urging him not to throw his life away out of guilt. \"Mackey loved you \u2026 be strong as u can, study and do pushups.\"\n\nSean-Paul and Kylen were on a hike in 2019 when they met Crystal Turner (38), sometimes referred to as Crystal Beck. Though 14 years older and a foot shorter than Kylen, the two women bonded over their love of the outdoors. Soon, love blossomed. On April 20, 2021, they married in a treehouse in Crystal\u2019s home state of Arkansas. By August, they were living in their camper van in the La Sal Mountains in Utah, a popular tourist location near the Arches National Park. Kylen worked at the Moonflower Community Cooperative in Moab, where she was praised for her work ethic. Crystal worked at McDonalds but she was planning to start a new job at Trailhead Public House across the street from the Moonflower. By all accounts, they were well-liked, in love and had a good life together. \u201cTheir love just shined bright,\u201d Sean-Paul said. \u201cYou couldn't help but look at them and go, \u2018Wow, what\u2019s going on with these two?\u2019 One tall, young and beautiful, one short and a little bit older, leathered up and toughened up. One cares about flowers and butterflies and the other cares about Harleys and medium rare steaks.\"\n\nPictures/video of the couple: [https://people.com/crime/friend-who-found-bodies-of-missing-moab-couple-recalls-devastating-campsite-discovery/](https://people.com/crime/friend-who-found-bodies-of-missing-moab-couple-recalls-devastating-campsite-discovery/)\n\n**LAST SIGHTING**\n\nBoth victims were last seen alive on August 13, 2021, at a bar called Woody\u2019s Tavern around 9.30pm. No one approached them or followed them out of the bar according to witnesses. They are also captured in security footage, in which they appear relaxed, talking and laughing with a female friend before returning to the table where they were sitting with a small group. However, Kylen told friends at this meeting that a \u201ccreepy man\u201d had been lurking close to their campsite and harassing them. To other friends, Kylen texted a tongue-in-cheek warning that if something happened to them, they were murdered by this creepy man. Bridget Calvert confirmed this. \u201cThey said they were going to pack up and move their campsite, that he was still creeping them out.\u201d A friend of the couple, Kayla Borza, who was one of the last people to see the two women alive, said: \u201cWe were just having a great time, having a couple drinks, and all they said was there was a creep \\[staying\\] next to them. And that was it.\u201d \n\n**DISAPPEARANCE**\n\nThe following day, Kylen and Crystal failed to turn up for work. On August 18, 2021, after the couple had been out of contact for three days, local woman Cindy Sue Hunter received a call from Sean-Paul, who now lived back in Montana, asking for help locating Kylen and Crystal. He too had heard the creeper story. Cindy Sue drove around the area, growing increasingly worried. She was still on the phone with Sean-Paul when she found Kylen\u2019s remains in a creek. Cindy Sue feared for her safety and fled the scene. Crystal\u2019s remains were discovered later, very close to Kylen\u2019s. Both women had multiple gunshot wounds on their backs, sides and/or chests. Police have stated that there was no sign of forcible sexual assault but they were both undressed from the waist down. One of the women was wearing a bra that had been pushed up to expose her breasts.\n\n**INVESTIGATION**\n\nThe couple had three vehicles: a 1987 black Ford Econoline van, a silver Kia Sorento and a Harley Davidson. All three were accounted for, along with a camping tent and a makeshift pet shelter. Their rabbit Ruth was unharmed. The Harley Davidson was still parked in town. Inside the van was a journal full of newspaper clippings, notes, phone numbers, mail and pay stubs. There was also a Bible, a damaged black Samsung Galaxy 8 and drug paraphernalia, including an electronic scale, a glass weed pipe and a plastic container with cannabis residue. Nothing initially appeared to have been stolen. The first statement made by the Grand County Sheriff's Office stated there was no current danger to the public. This was met with some criticism. Locals thought this stance was motivated by tourism, as opposed to any known facts in the case.\n\nBlood, shell casings, bullet fragments and video evidence from nearby properties were gathered. A tip mentioned firearms that were stolen just weeks before Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner were murdered. One of those weapons is pretty unique and could match the unusual bullet casings found at the scene of the crime. \"It's a silver-colored 9 mm bullet,\" Sean-Paul said. \"It's a very specific ammo.\" Four casings were also found, according to a search warrant from the Grand County Sheriff's Office. An incident report from the Montezuma County Sheriff's Office confirmed that a 9 mm Turkish-made pistol was reported stolen, along with a Turkish-made shotgun and bolt-action hunting rifle.\n\nOn August 19th, police searched the couple\u2019s van, still parked at McDonald\u2019s. According to the search warrant, the vehicle was \u201cunlawfully acquired\u201d and \u201chas been used or is possessed for the purpose of being used to commit or conceal the commission or an offense\u201d or \u201cevidence of illegal conduct\". Another search warrant revealed that investigators requested information from AT&T regarding a specific phone number belonging to one or both of the victims, which was never recovered. Recently, in March this year, a private investigator claimed that police had obtained an audio recording from near the crime scene on which gunshots and screams can be heard. According to the PI, the audio was recorded at 11:35 a.m. on August 14, 2021, the morning after Kylen and Crystal were last seen alive at Woody\u2019s bar. Police admitted the audio existed and that gunshots could be heard (they did not confirm screams). They confirmed the date but would not reveal the time.\n\n**SUSPECT**\n\nHours before the bodies were found, a Sheriff's Deputy made a traffic stop of a car displaying an Ohio license plate. This man behaved erratically enough to attract suspicion. He had made unwanted advances towards women in the past, on one occasion presenting a red rose to a cashier at the Moonflower Cooperative where Kylen worked. He said he\u2019d only met Kylen once briefly and denied being involved in their deaths. The man said he often slept outdoors and provided the location. Authorities found two blankets and a jacket stained with a substance that appeared to be blood. A forensic analysis determined that the evidence was unrelated to the murders. Police suspected that the man had untreated mental health issues. He was later cleared and is no longer considered a suspect. Authorities have apparently identified several persons of interest but the Grand County Sheriff's Office doesn't seem to have a solid suspect. The audio recordings may change this, however.\n\n**THEORIES** (from least credible to most credible)\n\n*They were killed by Brian Laundrie:* Kylen and Crystal are often mentioned in reference to another \u2018van life\u2019 murder victim, Gabby Petito. On August 12, 2021, one day before Kylen and Crystal were last seen alive, Laundrie assaulted Petito in front of the Moonflower. Kylen and Crystal apparently witnessed this altercation but another witness called 9-1-1. Officers identified the van near the entrance to Arches National Park and conducted a traffic stop. As we know, Laundrie later strangled Petito, but based on electronic transmission evidence, investigators have determined that neither Petito nor Laundrie were involved in the murders.\n\n*They were killed because of the shooting of Mackeon:* Though it\u2019s another tragic coincidence that both Kylen and her brother Mackeon died due to gun violence, it\u2019s probably not all that uncommon in the United States due to various factors. While I'm not completely convinced that all was forgiven between the Schulte and Culver families despite their best intentions, there\u2019s no evidence that connects the murders of Kylen and Crystal to MacKeon's death.\n\n*They were killed due to drugs:* A phone belonging to one of the victims was missing. An electronic scale and pipe were recovered, along with a small amount of cannabis. There were also some pills found in the van but they were mostly ibuprofen and amoxicillin. There is no evidence that they took harder drugs or were involved in any kind of serious criminality.\n\n*They were killed in a robbery gone wrong:* Nothing is missing from any of their vehicles other than a cellphone. Kylen and Crystal's camp was off a remote side road. The women were also shot mostly in the back, suggesting that they were running away and probably posed little threat to the killer. It's difficult to imagine a robber murdering two women for a phone that probably wasn't worth much, but it does happen and it can't be completely discounted due to the missing handset.\n\n*They were killed by someone they knew:* Kylen sent texts about the creeper and discussed him in public. Maybe the women were killed by someone close to them who knew where they'd be camping that night. The creeper would've been a convenient cover. Kylen was previously in an abusive relationship with a man; I'm not sure if he was ruled out, but this was years before the murders. Overall, there seems to be little known motive for this theory.\n\n*They were killed in a homophobic attack:* Kylen and Crystal were openly in a same-sex relationship. The cleared suspect was probed about his feelings on gay people, so police have considered the possibility. The couple shared photos on Instagram using the tags #vanlife and #wifelife, which could have made them a target to a bigoted stranger. Again, no evidence to support this - just a theory.\n\n*They were killed by an opportunist stranger:* They may have been chosen as victims based on a random encounter or the remoteness of their campsite rather than their identity. It's possible that they were observed at Woody's or elsewhere and trailed discreetly. At one time, police said they think the suspect left the area following the murders so probably isn't local.\n\n*They were killed by the creeper:* It isn\u2019t clear whether the suspect police interviewed was in fact the creepy guy the victims reported to their friends. There was only ever circumstantial evidence against the Moonflower employee with the Ohio plates. If this was the person they feared, he's probably not the killer - just a creepy guy. If Kylen and Crystal encountered a totally different creepy guy, he is yet to be identified. The motive may have been sexual despite no evidence of forcible sexual assault. \n\n\\--\n\nKylen had already overcome an abusive relationship and the untimely death of her brother. Crystal had likely endured struggles of her own. Despite this, they seem to have left a positive impression on those around them. It's tragic that they met such a horrible end, even more tragic if their case is forgotten. \u201cWe are asking that anyone that would have been in the South Mesa area between the dates of August 13th, August 14th, and 15th, contact our office with anything they may have seen or heard,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office has stated. Sean-Paul is also looking for information regarding any vehicles seen coming off forestry road 4651 in the La Sal mountains around the time of the murder.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\nGeneral articles: [https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/family-calls-for-answers-after-moab-couple-shot-dead-at-campsite](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/family-calls-for-answers-after-moab-couple-shot-dead-at-campsite) \\- [https://people.com/crime/friend-who-found-bodies-of-missing-moab-couple-recalls-devastating-campsite-discovery/](https://people.com/crime/friend-who-found-bodies-of-missing-moab-couple-recalls-devastating-campsite-discovery/) \\- [https://kjzz.com/news/local/warrants-in-moab-murders-reveal-second-vehicle-multiple-gunshots-creepy-man-drugs](https://kjzz.com/news/local/warrants-in-moab-murders-reveal-second-vehicle-multiple-gunshots-creepy-man-drugs) \\- [https://www.ksl.com/article/50295332/stolen-guns-may-match-bullet-casings-of-moab-double-homicide](https://www.ksl.com/article/50295332/stolen-guns-may-match-bullet-casings-of-moab-double-homicide) \n\nLast sightings:  [https://www.thedailybeast.com/surveillance-footage-shows-last-time-murdered-moab-camping-couple-kylen-schulte-and-crystal-beck-seen-alive?ref=scroll&fbclid=IwAR39geWQcGMZ-QdUCNLvwJCZmjNOEzLh3lzDLRBjsnMUhKhqrfmasupeY6Q](https://www.thedailybeast.com/surveillance-footage-shows-last-time-murdered-moab-camping-couple-kylen-schulte-and-crystal-beck-seen-alive?ref=scroll&fbclid=IwAR39geWQcGMZ-QdUCNLvwJCZmjNOEzLh3lzDLRBjsnMUhKhqrfmasupeY6Q) \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsJFwl-xV3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsJFwl-xV3o) \n\nVictim backgrounds: [https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/9/23/22683079/moab-murders-schulte-turner-case-gabby-petito-impacting-utah-town-grand-county-sheriff-moab-police](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/9/23/22683079/moab-murders-schulte-turner-case-gabby-petito-impacting-utah-town-grand-county-sheriff-moab-police) \\- [http://themurdersquad.com/episodes/the-murder-of-crystal-and-kylen/](http://themurdersquad.com/episodes/the-murder-of-crystal-and-kylen/) \\- [https://www.caruth-hale.com/obituaries/Crystal-Michelle-Turner?obId=22159339](https://www.caruth-hale.com/obituaries/Crystal-Michelle-Turner?obId=22159339)\n\nMackeon Schulte/Gabby Petito cases: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/25/parents-montana-teenager-shot-friend-tragic-accident](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/25/parents-montana-teenager-shot-friend-tragic-accident) \\- [https://eu.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2015/08/06/inquest-finds-montana-teen-shot-friend-justified/31209289/](https://eu.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2015/08/06/inquest-finds-montana-teen-shot-friend-justified/31209289/) \\- [https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/9/23/22683079/moab-murders-schulte-turner-case-gabby-petito-impacting-utah-town-grand-county-sheriff-moab-police](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/9/23/22683079/moab-murders-schulte-turner-case-gabby-petito-impacting-utah-town-grand-county-sheriff-moab-police) \\- [https://kslnewsradio.com/1962951/police-now-have-persons-of-interest-in-moab-double-murder/](https://kslnewsradio.com/1962951/police-now-have-persons-of-interest-in-moab-double-murder/)\n\nSuspect - [https://www.fox13now.com/news/crime/possible-suspect-revealed-in-new-documents-surrounding-grand-co-murders](https://www.fox13now.com/news/crime/possible-suspect-revealed-in-new-documents-surrounding-grand-co-murders) \\- [https://www.thedailybeast.com/moab-cops-rule-out-unnerving-man-grilled-in-case-of-crystal-turner-and-kylen-schulte-slain-camping-couple](https://www.thedailybeast.com/moab-cops-rule-out-unnerving-man-grilled-in-case-of-crystal-turner-and-kylen-schulte-slain-camping-couple) \\- [https://lawandcrime.com/crime/unnerving-man-questioned-after-unsolved-utah-double-homicide-behaved-with-combination-of-euphoria-and-that-hed-been-caught-doing-something-wrong-report/](https://lawandcrime.com/crime/unnerving-man-questioned-after-unsolved-utah-double-homicide-behaved-with-combination-of-euphoria-and-that-hed-been-caught-doing-something-wrong-report/)", "[Poland] Impact attenuator saves the life of a Kia driver ", "To show off your new stolen Kia ", "The Nature of Predators 34 [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wf7suw/the_nature_of_predators_33/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wkyqqu/the_nature_of_predators_35/)\n\n\\---\n\n**Memory transcription subject:** ***Captain Sovlin, Federation Fleet Command***\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: October 6, 2136*\n\nThe way the humans maneuvered through space was like a bird of prey, swooping down on its intended target. It was a graceful and emotionless flight, as I watched the blues and tans of my planet come into focus. Those in the UN fleet who shrugged off their assailants fell into position, and began to coordinate their next targets.\n\nMeanwhile, the dogged Arxur were forming ranks across the globe; they had no intent of relinquishing their position to a few primitives. Every sort of ammunition imaginable was ready to be lobbed at the first UN ship to stray too close. The Terrans weren\u2019t foolish enough to approach the reptilians directly, instead charting their course off to one side. Our nimble ships then hooked sharply back toward the fray, with surprising maneuverability.\n\n*I\u2019m surprised the Terrans spec\u2019d into speed. It\u2019s clear they tweaked whatever Venlil building blocks they got their hands on.*\n\nThe furless predators at our weapon station were growling over which enemy to take on. An indicator blinked red on my data feed, as the humans singled out the weakest link. I squinted at the viewport, studying their selection. The enemy ship\u2019s exterior had lost its shine, and its armor didn\u2019t look as thorough as its companions.\n\n\u201cDeploy missiles on target, and follow it up with everything our railgun\u2019s got.\u201d Captain Monahan\u2019s voice pierced the air, booming and authoritative. \u201cDivert all power to shields, as soon as we get a shot off.\u201d\n\nCarlos tapped me on the shoulder. \u201cHold on. We could be in for a rough ride. Let\u2019s hope our new developments in ablative armor pay off.\u201d\n\nWe banked toward our intended target, which seemed to be tracking us as well. A spray of kinetics battered our exterior, though they did little more than superficial damage. Terran ship design diverged slightly from the Federation, which meant the grays hadn\u2019t learned our weakness. The primates held much more intelligence about the Arxur than the other way around.\n\nAround us, UN ships were careening into the fray with guns blazing; pockets of fire littered the space in our periphery. I couldn\u2019t tell who was suffering more losses in this initial confrontation. The clash of two species of equal ferocity could only mean carnage. The bombing of the cradle ground to a halt, at least, as every ship was drawn away to address the vicious humans.\n\n*The fact that a large-scale conflict with apex predators is even close is a damn miracle. It\u2019s easy to forget the Earthlings developed FTL a few months ago,* I mused. *Imagine how indomitable they could be, given a few hundred years of practice. A scary thought.*\n\nAmidst my musings, our spacecraft pelted its opponent with a flurry of missiles. Prompt point defenses took out most of our firepower, but a handful detonated against the Arxur\u2019s armor. The rival ship struggled to regain its bearings, and was unable to return fire with its own munitions.\u00a0\n\nWhile dazed, and possibly with navigational troubles, its defenses had shrugged off our initial assault. The dilapidated Arxur vessel peeled back toward one of its compatriots, seeking backup. I could feel the roar of our engine, as we gave chase at full speed.\u00a0\n\nThe technicians at the weapons station were racing to get the shot off. Obliterating the grays with plasma would be a stylish finish. The enemy sensed that they were about to be nailed by the railgun, and yanked their nose skyward.\n\nThe humans failed to compensate for the change of course, and our plasma stream missed the mark by a wide margin. The reptilians were emboldened after skirting our heavy blow; they knew we would have to reload. Worse, they succeeded in drawing a partner\u2019s attention, and this late joiner was a newer Arxur model.\n\n\u201cRaise shields!\u201d the Terran captain barked. \u201cSwitch over to kinetics. Full speed toward the *UNS Lovecraft*.\u201d\n\nOur flight took on an erratic path, as the engines were pushed to their limit. The state-of-the-art, fresh Arxur partner had no trouble keeping pace with us, even at our maximum speed. This was back to what they were used to; chasing an enemy that knew they were beaten. The human predators were on their heels, like everyone else.\n\nThe Terrans sent off bursts of kinetic bullets, despite knowing full well that the grays\u2019 shields would absorb their punch. Right now, we needed to buy time to find our own backup; it couldn\u2019t hurt to throw everything in our arsenal at them. My sensors told me that both Arxur ships had us target-locked, and that couldn\u2019t be a good omen.\n\nOn screen, the allied *UNS Lovecraft* moseyed toward us; the flashy blue crest on its hull demonstrated it wasn\u2019t designed for camouflage. The rectangular shape, which seemed to boast retractable doors, suggested it could be transporting smaller craft. This human ship was an unseemly clump of mass and guns. A layer of paint didn\u2019t hide that it was a predatory prowler.\n\n*Some of their ships are definitely modified Venlil models, but this one? This screams humanity,* I thought.\n\nA sensors technician glanced at the captain. \u201cThe computer suggests the second Arxur hostile\u2019s railguns are charged. Evasive maneuvers are infeasible.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Monahan replied, her voice icy calm. \u201cBrace for impact.\u201d\n\nMy claws sank into the armrest, and nerves bubbled in my chest. Why were the humans not showing more alarm? An imminent threat on their lives should at least rattle anyone with a trace of sanity. I knew that these predators could feel fear from\u2026Marcel\u2019s responses to me.\n\nPlasma snaked toward us, hungry to devour our metallic shell. The white-hot blur plowed into an aft hangar; at least, that\u2019s where sensors registered the impact. My arm was nearly jerked out of its socket, as the force reached the bridge. The overhead lights snapped off from an electrical short-circuit, and baseboard lighting provided an eerie glow.\n\nThe predators that were standing found themselves on the ground. A few of the unfortunate crewmates faceplanted, and hobbled off to mend their injuries. Alarms warned that structural integrity was compromised. Atmosphere was venting from the rear sector, which would require repairs if we survived this battle.\n\n\u201c*UNS Rocinante,* you alright?\u201d a throaty voice crackled from the speakers.\n\nCaptain Monahan surveyed the bridge. \u201cStill in one piece, *Lovecraft.* We could use a hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard the lady,\u201d came the reply. \u201cLet her rip, boys.\u201d\n\nOur ship staggered down to avoid getting in their line of sight. The *Lovecraft* powered up twin railguns on its broad hull, undeterred by the energy demands. I doubted they could command the same power as a sole armament. The humans must believe wounding an enemy in two places offset that drawback.\n\nThe new-fangled Arxur wizened up to the peril a bit late. By the time it slowed its pace, Terran plasma was already in transit. Two simultaneous beams blazed scars on both flanks, connecting with several key systems. The drive-plume flickered out altogether, which meant our foe was out of commission.\n\nUN pilots steered the *Lovecraft* toward the original Arxur, and deployed missiles on target. With that monstrous warship on our side, confidence was restored within the bridge. Several humans\u2019 eyes glowed with anticipation of the kill; these predators smelled blood. While the aged vessel was preoccupied with the inbound parcel, the weapons station coaxed our ship\u2019s railgun back online.\n\nA plasma beam barreled toward its target with perfect aim, magnetically accelerated by my devious partners. My instincts told me the enemy was toast before it arrived. Some intuition sensed that the momentum had shifted in our favor, and the Terrans didn\u2019t need a second chance to capitalize.\n\nFire seared atop the enemy\u2019s armor, and its integrity collapsed. The scorched metal split open from side-to-side, leaving the ship powerless and immobilized. With its weapons systems knocked offline, the Arxur couldn\u2019t deploy interceptors against the *Lovecraft*\u2019s missile barrage. The vessel exploded in an orange burst, churned into metallic residue and fragments.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll leave a mark,\u201d came the gloating comment from our allies. \u201cWe\u2019re off to respond to another distress signal. Smooth sailing.\u201d\n\nCaptain Monahan offered her thanks over the comms, before reviewing the damage to our vessel. It wasn\u2019t quite as extensive as I would expect. There were some nasty wounds across the ship\u2019s body, but all major systems were functional. As long as there were no issues funneling power to weapons and propulsion, we were still in the fight.\n\nThe human officer straightened. \u201cNavs, bring us closer to the planet. Our structural integrity is weakened, so we\u2019re going to play a supporting role.\u201d\n\nI lowered my head for a moment, trying to cleanse some of the fear chemicals from my system. The exhilaration, of killing the Arxur, was lost beneath raw sensation. The burning in my chest was making it difficult to breathe, as if I was walking the line with cardiac arrest.\n\nWhile the predators breathing down my neck were dangerous and untamed, I was thankful they were at the helm. A human\u2019s split-second decision making, under duress, was clearly better than mine. Our brush with death struck more fear into my heart, than any of the surrounding crewmates.\n\n*And you\u2019re considered exceptionally brave at home,* I mused. *I suppose keeping it together enough to function, is what we consider stoicism.*\n\nOur vessel curved a winding path through the battlefield, avoiding a solo confrontation with any lurking Arxur. It was sobering to see that several dozen UN indicators had flickered out on our sensors. I hoped those measurements were erroneous, or that each fallen had at least taken two enemies with them.\n\nThe good news was that we had numbers. That advantage was minimized in clashes involving the Federation, when fleets often fell into disarray at the first sign of incoming fire. A bold charge, like the Terrans were attempting, was nigh unthinkable. We lost the psychological war before we ever thought of the physical one.\n\n\u201cSensors, pick out an enemy that\u2019s showing signs of critical damage.\u201d Captain Monahan nodded at the viewport, a thoughtful look on her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to limp off and nurse their wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn it,\u201d a technician answered.\n\nMy eyes turned toward the cradle, and homesickness burgeoned in my chest. Beneath the tranquil blue exterior, I knew the ground was ashen and lifeless. The Arxur ships, gliding above the atmosphere, menaced the skies. They were locked in combat with the humans now, but if our mission failed, they would return to their bombing in a heartbeat.\n\nA dark, rectangular object, which burned away from the planet\u2019s glow, caught my attention. There was only one Arxur ship that would flee from the heart of battle. My heart sank into my stomach, and I realized which target the Terrans had to choose. It was a small mercy, for the souls onboard.\n\nI leapt to my paws, ignoring the bile rising in my throat. \u201cTerminate the hostile labeled A9241, on your sensors. Please. It\u2019s on an ascent course, departing from the cradle.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on. Why that particular ship?\u201d Monahan asked.\n\nI met her steely gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s a cattle ship. It cannot be allowed to leave the system. Put those Gojids out of their misery, I beg you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are innocent hostages on that ship? We don\u2019t kill civilians, whenever it's possible to avoid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are fates *much* worse than death. Humans, please tell me you\u2019re logical enough to understand. There are children on there, and I know you care for them. You\u2019re saving hundreds of people from an existence you cannot imagine.\u201d\n\nThe captain studied her own readout, and waved the first officer over for a brief conference. I didn\u2019t know what she was discussing with him; it was an easy decision to me. Their hushed words gave the grays time to get away. Maybe these predators did have stunted morality, if they couldn\u2019t discern the lesser evil here. Forget the letter of the law!\n\nMonahan\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cSovlin, how many Arxur do you expect are onboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s ever been on one of their ships,\u201d I growled. \u201cBut, uh, their landing parties are usually around 2-3 dozen per group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems manageable. I\u2019ll put together a breach team, and we\u2019ll send a shuttle to board them. All we need is to knock out propulsion, so they\u2019re dead in the waters.\u201d\n\nThe proposition was so simple, yet it almost moved me to tears. I couldn\u2019t believe these savage beasts would attempt a rescue mission mid-battle, at grave peril to their own personnel. From how the UN captain reacted, it was her first instinct. The thought hadn\u2019t crossed my mind to think of those Gojids as anything but gone.\n\nAs the officers began assembling a flight crew, I realized there was a foundation of genuine trust forming. The idea that humanity would want the sapient livestock for themselves had barely crossed my mind. I\u2019d begun to believe that this \u201cconquering species\u201d would help us, just as they had with our refugees.\n\nCaptain Monahan barked orders to the bridge personnel, who began scrounging what energy they could for the plasma railgun. There was no time to await backup, and most UN ships were preoccupied regardless. The comms station notified all nearby friendlies of the cattle vessel, so that it wouldn\u2019t be shot down while we were trying to seize it. If reinforcements arrived down the line, that would be a bonus.\n\n\u201cSovlin, I\u2019m going to offer my name for the boarding party.\u201d Hatred radiated from Carlos, as his gaze scorched toward the viewport. \u201cI am a foot soldier, after all. I\u2019d like a crack at those gray freaks.\u201d\n\nThe humans\u2019 pent-up rage seeped out, as they contemplated the terrorizing foe. Hunger trickled into their stances and snarls. I could almost feel its burning hum through their veins. Wild, untapped anger spurred the primates to action, and demanded retribution for the cruelty they perceived.\n\n*They\u2019re channeling their predatory energy. But they\u2019re still in control of themselves, somehow, even in hunting mode. I can\u2019t imagine the intrusive thoughts it puts in their heads.*\n\nOur ship raced toward the Arxur\u2019s transport, gaining on the clunky object. Cattle vessels did have external weapons, but they were more limited than their warship counterparts. However, their internal armory wouldn\u2019t be deficient, by any metric; they were equipped with the tools to eviscerate a city. This wasn\u2019t going to be an easy task for my human allies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all so noble, and fearsome,\u201d I growled. \u201cCaptain Monahan, let me accompany your team, please.\u201d\n\nThe captain raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhy would I do that? So the only Federation asset we have can be KIA?\u201d\n\n\u201cKIA?\u201d\n\n\u201cKilled in action.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, uh, I won\u2019t get in your way. If you manage to free those Gojids, you\u2019ll need me to stop a stampede. They\u2019re not going to be in their right minds. You\u2019ll\u2026see why.\u201d\n\nMonahan\u2019s rosy lips twitched, and I could sense the unspoken question on her tongue. After witnessing our lack of composure, during their initial landing, she wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be in my right mind. It was a valid question, honestly. Charging through an enclosed space, surrounded by Arxur and gunfighting, would break most Gojids.\n\nThe mere sight of binocular eyes pumped dread through my veins, and made my spines bristle. It was a constant effort to push that aside, but I could power through it in most cases. My fury toward the grays *had* to be enough to override it. I tried to show my determination through teeth-baring, raising my claws in a threatening manner.\n\nShe sighed, rubbing her forehead. \u201cVery well. Don\u2019t fuck this up, and\u2026for the love of God, don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered. \u201cJust, er, if the mission fails, please take out that ship. No matter who\u2019s onboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t make it out of this system. Not on my watch.\u201d\n\nA wave of livid excitement almost swept me off my feet, as I eyed the cattle vessel in the viewport. Few people met an Arxur face-to-face, and lived to tell the tale. Insertion into an enemy ship could end in complete catastrophe; such a feat would be unheard of.

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--> Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building.

The way it introduces new gameplay mechanics, combined with its great story, makes it one of the best of the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Preston Dozsa](https://opencritic.com/critic/4878/preston-dozsa) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is a refreshing return to the series\u2019 roots, emphasizing its tactical complexity that surpasses more recent entries in the franchise while still featuring a charming cast of characters.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [James Paley](https://opencritic.com/critic/2831/james-paley) - [82 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/fire-emblem-engage-review/)\n\n>While Engage didn\u2019t win me over with its story, the mechanics are a different matter. I\u2019m pleased that level grinding is being sidestepped in such a clever manner, though I still miss it. I loved how intense the battles are, every single time. Even with the Time Crystal, the stakes feel terribly high. Sure, the narrative feels more clich\u00e9 than I\u2019m used to. I wish it wasn\u2019t a good vs evil fetch quest. But the character bonds still tell a compelling tale all on their own. And though I didn\u2019t love the side content this time around, I\u2019m still happy there\u2019s so much of it available. Overall, Fire Emblem Engage is an excellent entry in the franchise. You won\u2019t want to miss this one.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Manuel Barthes](https://opencritic.com/critic/4593/manuel-barthes) - *German* - [7.9 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-fire-emblem-engage-ein-solider-ableger-mit-einer-grossen-portion-nostalgie/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage unfortunately fails to shine like its predecessor Three Houses. The step back to the roots of the series wasn't a bad one at all. Above all, the combat system knows how to inspire thanks to the emblems, the reunion with Marth and Co. was successful. Unfortunately, the unspectacular story, its generic characters and the lack of endgame content reduce the gaming experience a lot.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Edie W-K](https://opencritic.com/critic/6031/edie-w-k) - [6.5 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2023/01/fire-emblem-engage-review-ceding-ground/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is an okay addition to the Fire Emblem series, with fun and varied maps and enough changes to the tactical mechanics to make it probably worth playing for any FE fan, though not all of its changes are winners. Its spectacular graphics are something to behold; it's just a shame that it is accompanied by a story that falls completely flat and emblem heroes that are shadows of their former selves. It's just sadly underwhelming in the face of what its predecessor, Three Houses, achieved better.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [Recommended](https://www.consolecreatures.com/review-fire-emblem-engage/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage brings back the classic strategic role-playing game, giving you a superb adventure that is full of excellent and exciting characters with gameplay to match.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter) - [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-engage/)\n\n>If you were overwhelmed by Three Houses, this is a great follow-up that doesn\u2019t just follow that same formula: and in many ways, gets back to Fire Emblem basics.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digital Trends](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends)** - [Giovanni Colantonio](https://opencritic.com/critic/6533/giovanni-colantonio) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fire-emblem-engage-review-nintendo-switch/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is another reliable hit in the tactics series, even if it isn't as much a step forward as previous installments.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitally Downloaded](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)** - [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2023/01/review-fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch.html)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is everything I love about Fire Emblem, bundled up in a way that does justice to both the classics that got me into the series, and the production values of modern gaming.

By carrying the heroes of other campaigns through the emblems, Engage seems to risk everything for the sake of a narrative that gives all the guarantees, even when it ends up punching the player's stomach. The outfit and the character's character are other reinforced elements, as well as the remarkable voice work, both in Japanese and English. With the combat system, leisure options in Somniel and equipment management reinforced, Emblem reaches a new level in the growth of the series. It's my favorite Fire Emblem.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Antonello Bello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2994/antonello-bello) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-fire-emblem-engage-passo-innovazione-nostalgia-60137.html)\n\n>Despite initial misgivings, Fire Emblem Engage has proved to be a solid and articulated strategy game\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [S\u00f6nke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [89%](https://www.games.ch/fire-emblem-engage/test/review-kjaK/)\n\n>\"Fire Emblem Engage\" turns out to be the hoped-for tactical spectacle with considerable scope. For more than two dozen chapters, you'll experience nerve-wracking battles that are at their best, especially in Classic mode with the permadeath function turned on. The new break and emblem ring mechanics fit perfectly into the proven combat system, the design of the battlefields always holds interesting surprises in store, side missions are regularly linked to the unlocking of new additional characters, and the story is also peppered with some twists that we did not always see coming. Alear's Ring Odyssey is rounded off by a staging that is absolutely worth seeing by Switch standards, a bombastic soundtrack and numerous multiplayer functions that promise a lot of long-term motivation.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Wesley LeBlanc](https://opencritic.com/critic/9014/wesley-leblanc) - [9 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/propelling-to-the-future-using-the-past)\n\n>Players looking for deep customization, expertly crafted strategy RPG combat, and a heartfelt story with adoration for more than 30 years of Fire Emblem history will find that and more in Engage.

The addition of the Emblem Rings which bring heroes of the past games is a nice touch. However, the decision of removing so many great features that were in Theee House, makes Engage a weaker title in my opinion.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Glitched Africa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa)** - [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello) - [9 / 10](https://www.glitched.africa/fire-emblem-engage-review-a-love-letter-to-a-great-series/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is one of the best games in the series.

Sadly, that\u2019s not the case. Fire Emblem Engage scales its social interactions down to a bare minimum, leaving a cast of underdeveloped characters in its wake. At the same time, it features some of Fire Emblem\u2019s best tactical combat, making the game feel as sharply divided as its protagonist\u2019s over-discussed red-and-blue hair.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [David Jenkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/368/david-jenkins) - [8 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review-better-than-three-houses-18109551/)\n\n>A more traditional Fire Emblem experience than Three Houses, but one that's filled with fun new features and emphasises deep and varied gameplay over dating mini-games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [PJ O'Reilly](https://opencritic.com/critic/1742/pj-oreilly) - [9 / 10](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fire-emblem-engage)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is another stellar entry in this storied franchise, but it's also one that takes a noticeably different stance than its most recent predecessor. It's all about the combat this time around, at the expense of the relationships and romance that made Three Houses such a fan favourite, so if you're looking for that social element here, you're bound to be left feeling at least a tad disappointed. However, for those jonesing to get down and dirty with some sweet turn-based tactical action - action that's embedded in a satisfyingly OTT, beautifully presented anime narrative - this is as fine an example of the genre as you'll play this year.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Matthew Zawodniak](https://opencritic.com/critic/5608/matthew-zawodniak) - [9 / 10](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/62622/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review)\n\n>I have never played a game quite so ravenously, sinking over ninety hours into my first playthrough in just two weeks (though don't get too intimidated by that number, it counts all of my resets from playing on Hard difficulty, and I also played all fifteen optional chapters). At the end of it all I didn't feel exhausted or burnt out, but rather like I somehow wished that I could play for even longer. Fire Emblem Engage may not check every box that fans were hoping for, but it is easily the strongest showing for the series in the last decade.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PCMag](https://opencritic.com/outlet/314/pcmag)** - [Will Greenwald](https://opencritic.com/critic/1664/will-greenwald) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/fire-emblem-engage)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage recalls earlier series entries by hitting familiar tactical notes, but it augments them with a cool, new team-up system.

Whether the reverence for the social elements of Three Houses came as a surprise to the team or not, the dearth of those moments in Engage makes it feel like it\u2019s missing half of its core at times. While the anniversary cameos will please the hardcore fans at first, we worry that, much like the weak social aspects, their largely minor impact on the game itself will disappoint.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Video Chums](https://opencritic.com/outlet/624/video-chums)** - [A.J.

Classic Fire Emblem combat mechanics make their welcome return here and are nicely elevated by the new Engage system and a slate of varied, surprisingly-challenging maps. Fire Emblem Engage won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s favorite entry in the series, but it should be a critical hit with many seasoned generals.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Ralph Panebianco](https://opencritic.com/critic/5428/ralph-panebianco) - [7 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/fire-emblem-engage-review/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is enjoyable but leaves little impression. If the narrative was more compelling, if the character relationships were deeper and more interesting or if combat was more varied, there's every chance that Engage would have felt more robust and impactful.

I'd like to get your thoughts. It's been quite some time, but figured I'd post it anyway.\n\nI'm  working on a draft piece, as stated in the OP title, and given KiA's significance from the get-go, it seemed prudent to hear what its current or active long-time members have to say.\n\nI won't divulge names or anything deemed too personal, unless specifically requested. While I can't promise anything, and the ending article may not necessarily paint KiA in a \"positive\" light, I still want to be as fair as possible. That being said, I'd like to ask the following:\n\n1. How long have you been active in criticizing trends in gaming and fandom? This doesn't necessarily mean \"active in KiA,\" though if you wish, you could include so.\n2. How has KiA changed since you first got involved?\n3. Subfactions have emerged within KiA over time, some more vocal than others. Is there merit in such observations, or has one such movement won out?\n4. How do you respond to \"criticisms\"? On a related note, what are your thoughts on gatekeeping?\n5. How would you distinguish good-faith and bad-faith critiques or hot takes?\n6. Given how long it's been since GamerGate started, would you consider the other side as having \"won/lost\" or lost relevance? Similarly, do you consider KiA still relevant/significant?\n7. What are your thoughts on the present state of video games and fandom?\n8. What are your thoughts on One Angry Gamer, at least when Billy Usher ran it, and the general mindset that cultivated before its slide into irrelevancy?\n9. Given growing toxicity in discourse and a seemingly parallel decline in empathy, how do you see the end of culture wars? If possible, what would be the best outcome?\n10. What would you say to those either on the fence, or not as \"invested\" in said culture wars?\n\nThese questions are more like guidelines than anything else. And if you feel apprehensive, if not suspicious, it's understandable. Still, I like to hear your takes on this, KiA!\n\nThis thread will kept open, so please go right on ahead! One again, thank you all!\n\nEDIT: Polished the questions.\n\nEDIT 2: Apologies for the lack of responses on my end right now, but thanks again for all your messages!

Its spectacular graphics are something to behold; it's just a shame that it is accompanied by a story that falls completely flat and emblem heroes that are shadows of their former selves.

Sadly, that\u2019s not the case. Fire Emblem Engage scales its social interactions down to a bare minimum, leaving a cast of underdeveloped characters in its wake. At the same time, it features some of Fire Emblem\u2019s best tactical combat, making the game feel as sharply divided as its protagonist\u2019s over-discussed red-and-blue hair.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [David Jenkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/368/david-jenkins) - [8 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review-better-than-three-houses-18109551/)\n\n>A more traditional Fire Emblem experience than Three Houses, but one that's filled with fun new features and emphasises deep and varied gameplay over dating mini-games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [PJ O'Reilly](https://opencritic.com/critic/1742/pj-oreilly) - [9 / 10](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fire-emblem-engage)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is another stellar entry in this storied franchise, but it's also one that takes a noticeably different stance than its most recent predecessor. It's all about the combat this time around, at the expense of the relationships and romance that made Three Houses such a fan favourite, so if you're looking for that social element here, you're bound to be left feeling at least a tad disappointed. However, for those jonesing to get down and dirty with some sweet turn-based tactical action - action that's embedded in a satisfyingly OTT, beautifully presented anime narrative - this is as fine an example of the genre as you'll play this year.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Matthew Zawodniak](https://opencritic.com/critic/5608/matthew-zawodniak) - [9 / 10](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/62622/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review)\n\n>I have never played a game quite so ravenously, sinking over ninety hours into my first playthrough in just two weeks (though don't get too intimidated by that number, it counts all of my resets from playing on Hard difficulty, and I also played all fifteen optional chapters). At the end of it all I didn't feel exhausted or burnt out, but rather like I somehow wished that I could play for even longer. Fire Emblem Engage may not check every box that fans were hoping for, but it is easily the strongest showing for the series in the last decade.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PCMag](https://opencritic.com/outlet/314/pcmag)** - [Will Greenwald](https://opencritic.com/critic/1664/will-greenwald) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/fire-emblem-engage)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage recalls earlier series entries by hitting familiar tactical notes, but it augments them with a cool, new team-up system. Its multiplayer modes need work, though.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Polygon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon)** - [Mike Mahardy](https://opencritic.com/critic/1415/mike-mahardy) - [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23554012/fire-emblem-engage-review-divine-nintendo-switch-release-date)\n\n>It can\u2019t quite reach the crescendos that Three Houses did, and it certainly doesn\u2019t achieve the longevity of Awakening. But it is consistently great.

Whether the reverence for the social elements of Three Houses came as a surprise to the team or not, the dearth of those moments in Engage makes it feel like it\u2019s missing half of its core at times. While the anniversary cameos will please the hardcore fans at first, we worry that, much like the weak social aspects, their largely minor impact on the game itself will disappoint.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Video Chums](https://opencritic.com/outlet/624/video-chums)** - [A.J.

Classic Fire Emblem combat mechanics make their welcome return here and are nicely elevated by the new Engage system and a slate of varied, surprisingly-challenging maps. Fire Emblem Engage won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s favorite entry in the series, but it should be a critical hit with many seasoned generals.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Ralph Panebianco](https://opencritic.com/critic/5428/ralph-panebianco) - [7 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/fire-emblem-engage-review/)\n\n>Fire Emblem Engage is enjoyable but leaves little impression. If the narrative was more compelling, if the character relationships were deeper and more interesting or if combat was more varied, there's every chance that Engage would have felt more robust and impactful. In the absence of those things, Engage just feels\u2026fine.\n\n-------------", "ITZY - The 2nd World Tour: BORN TO BE (Announcement / Schedule Poster) ", "2023 SUGA | Agust D Tour Megathread # Hi!

On a grander scale, the gap we\u2019d cleared with three rounds of antimatter bombs had sealed. The UN drones had borrowed seconds for us against hopeless numbers, falling by the thousands; half of our allies were situated on the other side of the shadow fleet, but were unable to help us retreat due to their own problems. Turning back wasn\u2019t an option, and with that door closed, it was a matter of avoiding immediate death. The nuclear weapons tucked away on the moon were launched as soon as we got past the fleet, leaving us quite the radioactive payload to evade. Drones scrambled to cut them down, despite having Kolshians spitting plasma at their heels.\n\nWhile our drones on this side of the globe had suffered heavy casualties, manned ships hadn\u2019t gone unscathed either. Our vessel had taken a beating, with several direct hits to our underbelly, and we lacked any shields once those were taken down. Honestly, if someone didn\u2019t engineer a way to facilitate a shield current despite magnetoresistance, they were all but useless in future battles; the United Nations hadn\u2019t scrounged up any alternative innovations on that front yet. While I had my eyes on any missile launches, we couldn\u2019t afford to take many more hits from conventional weapons as well; our craft was hanging together by a thread, with a single love tap able to cause structural integrity to unravel.\n\n*Even if Sovlin, Carlos, and Samantha are able to gain control of the ground stations, that will take time. I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re supposed to hold out against nukes, free shots for planetary defense lasers, and shadow fleet ships.*\n\nThe Terran fighters were mere nuisances to the drones, and were getting their asses handed to them. Though it was difficult to discern through the sea of sensor blips, the Duerten Shield and Sapient Coalition seemed to be struggling against a Dominion assault. The Arxur had brought tons of spacecraft into the fray; while the avian alliance was showing novel aggression, the grays were the seasoned veterans in that department. The carnivores hadn\u2019t been expecting such a fight from the Homogeneity, but they adapted their strategies swiftly. Concurrently, on the far side of Aafa, Chief Hunters Ilthiss and Usliff\u2019s fleet had been reduced to stray remnants. The UN drones and Technocracy craft there were left outnumbered, on their own, and unable to join our engagement by the moon.\n\n\u201cThis is *not* how we wanted the battle to go. Particle beams alone won\u2019t win this fight,\u201d I hissed.\n\nTyler scratched his blond scalp. \u201cLet\u2019s hope taking the planetary defenses is enough. We don\u2019t have many tricks left in the bag. \u2018Less ya got something in mind, Onso?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is to get somewhere those lasers can\u2019t have free rein to shoot us. Except we can\u2019t go back the way we came, and we\u2019ve suffered enormous losses. The way I see it, we just need more ships. The Shield and Ilthiss just don\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis goes to show why we ain\u2019t provoked the Dominion. We didn\u2019t wanna fight them and the shadow fleet at the same time, or for Betterment to know how much we had their number. Guess that ship has sailed, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if things get much worse, the Duerten will follow through on their promise to bomb Aafa. Since we are on the brink of defeat, maybe you should tell them to.\u201d\n\nMy friend\u2019s jaw muscles tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to authorize that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. Neither do I, after seeing how senseless the glassing of Caato was\u2026but even if we flip the planetary defenses, it\u2019ll be too late to bring back our losses. We might\u2019ve lost fifty thousand ships across all our allies, which is a large chunk of our fleet. Enemy casualties are *maybe* twenty thousand so far, and that\u2019s almost solely from particle weapons\u2026which most of our fleet doesn\u2019t have. I don\u2019t see a scenario where we win here.\u201d\n\nThe sensors officer\u2019s scowl deepened, displeased with my suggestions. His blue eyes seemed to be counting the minutes that had passed since Sovlin and his team leapt into space; they should be barging into the complexes by now, given how close their landing sites were. It was a miracle we\u2019d managed to keep out of range and alive that long. What would happen to the troops if we fell, and they were left stranded on that moon with limited oxygen? What would become of humanity and the Yotul, if our all-out attack came up short? I supposed before drastic, scorched-earth action would be authorized, we should see if the planetary defenses could be impactful enough.\n\nA laser from the moon was identified as aiming at us, leaving us mere seconds to swerve off its vector. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, as my brain came up empty of any last-ditch strategies. We would\u2019ve won this battle if it was just the Kolshians; we\u2019d done admirably to make it this far, with the Dominion joining in. But now, I could see two shadow fleet vessels tearing after us, lining us up for when their plasma weapons recharged. I desperately passed along the nearest drone\u2019s coordinates to weapons, but thanks to the foe\u2019s dramatic twirl, our shot didn\u2019t cripple it like I\u2019d hoped. It merely made a dent in its armor, so meaningless that the hostile didn\u2019t slow in its pursuit.\n\nThere had been a momentary pause in the planetary defense firing, but I could see the entire complex lighting up below us now. It was a shame we were out of bombing range, and that we\u2019d committed to foot soldiers taking the installation regardless. I fumbled with the sensor readout, searching to map the laser\u2019s path. How were we meant to dodge two plasma beams that would tear off any second, *and* a laser? We still had a physical barrier to deploy to impede one incoming munition, but we couldn\u2019t shield both sides. I made a split-second decision, and relayed the suggestion to drop it in front of the shadow fleet. While the lasers were stronger, the chances of evading synchronized plasma arcs were slim without some fortress.\n\nCaptain Monahan\u2019s weary eyes turned to the bridge crew. \u201cWe\u2019ve received word from our unit leaders on the ground. All planetary defenses are under our control, except for a single module that was able to initiate self-destruct.\u201d\n\nI could see an explosion near the shadowy border of the moon, where sunlight wasn\u2019t illuminating its cratered surface. The sensors readout had switched the defense complexes to friendly indicators, after that new info was fed into its database. I tilted my head in confusion, wondering why the nearest lasers were powering up and pointing at us. My befuddlement turned into a laugh, perhaps a sign that I was delirious from the stress of the battle. We might not be on track to win the battle, but it was amusing that the shadow fleet had no idea what was coming. A bluish flash radiated from the powerful weapons, and I tracked its lightning-quick path across the viewport.\n\nThe complex\u2019s computer had charted the optimal angle to sizzle through both Kolshian drones, splicing them clean in half before the algorithms realized what changed. Planetary defenses revved to life on our side, finally granting some breathing room to our battered fleet. Without having to worry about flying straight into a stream of hostile lasers, I relayed a suggested course to sensors; it would take us as close to the lunar surface as possible. Further, that locale was in the blind spot of the complexes, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about friendly fire. It would also aid in getting the shuttles, evacuating our soldiers, back onto the ship. As insensitive as Sovlin could be, it felt weird standing on the bridge without his jabs.\n\nWith our former pursuers dead in the water, our warship beelined toward the moon with a new lease on life. I highlighted the marker of the UN shuttle assigned to our vessel, seeing that it was circling over the evac point. The soldiers would need a few minutes to travel by foot to the pickup site; to my knowledge, the rovers had been left behind and jury-rigged with explosives, in case any Kolshians thought to retake the facilities. Sovlin, Samantha, and Carlos wouldn\u2019t return for a little while longer. I tried to focus on picking out long-range targets, knowing that we needed to tilt casualties in our favor. The lasers had struck down thousands of enemies, in the brief span we had them online, but the Kolshians were mobilizing on a bombing route.\n\nWe had to push the shadow fleet back, despite how ill-equipped we were. It would be nice if we could rally the Technocracy and UN vessels from the other side of the globe, but they were in hot water. The shadow fleet was pelting them with missiles and plasma, and if the hostiles burned through their munition stores, they would ram themselves into Terran ships. We couldn\u2019t replicate that crash and burn strategy, given that we were outnumbered. Back on our side, it would be a sacrificial play, summoning the Duerten Shield and the Sapient Coalition to hound the Kolshians from behind. Still, even though the Dominion had them on their heels, I thought we had to bring them to us.\n\n*If the planetary defenses are bombed out, with hardly a chance to rack up casualties, it\u2019s over. We got mowed down like flies taking the complex, so we need an equalizer.*\n\nI pinned my ears back against my head. \u201cTyler\u2026sir. Have comms reach out to the Duerten. I know they won\u2019t like orders from us, but persuade them to abandon their positions against the Arxur. We need *something* to hound the shadow fleet from behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Shield will be massacred, and then the Dominion will come at us too!\u201d Officer Cardona objected.\n\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019ll keep them at bay for a few extra minutes. We\u2019ve invested too much in the planetary defenses. The UN drones took too many losses on our side to get us to the drop point, and we can\u2019t handle the shadow fleet alone. The lasers are all we have; it's a simple calculation of what the greatest asset is.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck. We can\u2019t have gone through all of this to lose the lasers, and the Shield *are* gonna fall one-on-one with the Arxur anyway. I\u2019ll\u2026have Monahan pass along the message. She\u2019ll tell them the truth\u2014that it\u2019s the only way\u2014and hope they go for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you remind them that this is all to stop the shadow fleet from marching on Kalqua, I believe the Duerten will make that sacrifice. They want to bring the Kolshians down, at all costs.\u201d\n\nMy human friend shuffled off, and I snuck a glimpse at the shuttle\u2019s sensor dot near the lunar surface. It was lifting off with our crewmates in tow, assuming all had gone well. Sovlin was a brave Gojid, to pull that death-defying stunt alongside the primates; I couldn\u2019t wait to hear some version of how a primitive like me wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle a jet pack (ignoring the fact I\u2019d used them during maintenance spacewalks). Regardless of our fleet\u2019s dire straits in the battle for the galaxy, some things never changed. If there wasn\u2019t some kind of comment about my intellectual capacity, I would be concerned.\n\nMy attention returned to the present circumstances on the bridge, where Monahan huddled over her comms. I didn\u2019t envy that conversation, but whatever she was saying seemed to be working. The Shield was trying to sidestep the Arxur vessels, who\u2019d moved in for an up-close-and-personal kill. The Sapient Coalition was running interference; as the weakest links, their prey crews still proved selfless, standing in the way of blistering guns. Our plasma weapons could land a few long range shots, but between drone evasion capabilities and distance, our accuracy was lacking. Watching our side\u2019s desperate actions now, I wished I hadn\u2019t gotten my hopes up back when early reinforcements entered the system.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t go doom and gloom on me.\u201d Tyler tapped his palm against the work station for my attention. \u201cYour spirits look in the toilets, my man, and I won\u2019t be having that at my station. Give me one piece of good news, Onso.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, we\u2019re not dead yet?\u201d My tail drooped further between my legs, as I struggled to find a bright side. Reading the shuttle\u2019s passenger data, which showed 3 KIAs listed among the dozens of soldiers returning to our ship, meant I couldn\u2019t attest to our friends\u2019 safety. \u201cOh, I got one positive. Sovlin, Sam, and Carlos are heading back on the shuttle now\u2026assuming they\u2019re alive, we\u2019ll see them soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic! Y\u2019know, I was worried about sending that Gojid out on somethin\u2019 extreme like that. He\u2019s really come a long way since we first met him, and I\u2019m glad we got a chance to make everything right between us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy making things right, you mean that you punched him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was angry\u2014you gotta know what that\u2019s like, Onso. My knuckles may have *grazed* his jaw, but it all worked out. This fight will work out too, so keep your head in the game. I need you to keep watch for the Dominion ships, in case they turn on us. We gotta fight to our last and be ready if the whole damn fleet comes at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll have the Arxur\u2019s vectors mapped pronto. It might help to forward any assessments to the SC and the Shield.\u201d\n\nTyler gave me a hearty clap on the back, as I tried not to watch the Shield and Coalition bleed numbers. The Duerten were hurling munitions toward the shadow fleet with fury, forcing some to turn their attention away from our encampment by the moon. The Arxur hadn\u2019t relented for a moment, and I could see their ships burning full thrusters ahead in our direction. However, in between my last visual and the present one, it seemed like something had discombobulated them. Their movements looked uncertain and disoriented, like they\u2019d been thrown out of subspace by a disruptor pulse. My inquisitiveness prompted me to solve the puzzle, seeking out what had caused the sudden hesitation.\n\nThe majority of the Dominion ships seemed to reach a decision, forging ahead with shaky focus. However, before my watching eyes, an inexplicable breakdown occurred. Some Arxur vessels began firing on their own remnants; other agitated hunter craft turned their sights away from the Duerten, and peppered the shadow fleet from behind. A handful were shooting at both the Shield and Coalition, *and* their own side, blurring their allegiance even further. Any semblance of cohesion broke down with the in-fighting, as no party had a clue where to turn their guns. The Kolshians were taken off-guard by the grays\u2019 betrayal, and after a moment of consideration, began shooting all Arxur vessels with blanket condemnation.\n\n\u201cSir, the Arxur and the Kolshians started shooting at each other\u2026why, I have no clue. Ilthiss said he couldn\u2019t get through the comms embargo,\u201d I explained. \u201cWhat I can say is the same chaos is unfolding on the planet\u2019s flip side. Our drones seem to be having a resurgence in efficacy.\u201d\n\nTyler\u2019s frosty eyes widened. \u201cThis changes everything. We have to seize this opportunity, while they\u2019re reeling!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you say it? \u2018Damn straight.\u2019 We need to kick their ass before Sovlin shows up, so he can know we did it all without him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno about that. There\u2019s still hundreds of thousands of ships to clear out, even if a shit-ton of the ones here were Dominion. How many are on our side? We could have numbers in our favor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so simple, sir, but the Kolshians are treating the Arxur *all* as hostiles. So I\u2019d venture the ones who hadn\u2019t turned on their mission will now. My\u2026opinion is that we should target the shadow fleet with everything we have.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Damn straight*. Whatever we have left, we\u2019ll have it flying at them ASAP!\u201d\n\nTrue to my conjecture, the Kolshians\u2019 targeting of all Arxur vessels resulted in Betterment\u2019s entire fleet rounding on them. As the eye-popping number of ships on both sides traded blows, it was clear that the shadow fleet was annihilating the Dominion. While the grays landed thousands of kills through ship volume, their ranks were being ravaged much quicker. The Duerten Shield rallied among the confusion, eagerly shoving antimatter bombs meant for Aafa down the shadow fleet\u2019s throat. Any nanodrones and cluster bombs the UN had left assailed the enemy, capitalizing on the confusion. Planetary defenses had never been contested, thanks to the diversion, and were still cranking out ship-ending lasers without refrain.\n\nI eagerly passed along a target for our plasma railgun, and noted that the indicator denoting Sovlin\u2019s transport had crossed into our ship. With the Gojid likely on his way to the bridge, I spared a glance back toward the other side of the globe; there wouldn\u2019t be any gaps in my knowledge for him to question. The Yotul Technocracy was being aggressive in hounding the shadow fleet. With the Arxur to distract our foes, particle beams were surgically dissecting them. The Kolshians on that side were floundering enough that the UN could finally divert some drones to help our weaker flank here. We were on the cusp of winning the far half\u2019s engagement altogether, which should tilt the lunar fray heavily in our favor.\n\nMy mind was reeling after, out of nowhere, it seemed that we *could* end the Federation within the hour. What had changed inside of the Arxur fleet, enough to sow that much division? Had humanity found a way through their cybersecurity, or was something else going on? Dominion vessels were falling in with Ilthiss and Usliff\u2019s remnants on the far side, though on this half, their numbers were rapidly sinking toward zero. We needed to keep the pressure up while the shadow fleet\u2019s focus was still on the Arxur. The Kolshians had lost not just their allies, but tens of thousands of their own vessels to the betrayal.\n\n*Even with our losses earlier, we have the advantage after this change. We have particle beams and planetary defenses still in play, to aid our reinvigorated fleet.*\n\nI watched with bated breath, as I wondered if this sudden infusion of chaos would be the deciding factor in the Battle of Aafa. Victory was within humanity\u2019s grasp, and now, it was up to us not to let this opportunity slip away.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/181aqai/the_nature_of_predators_170/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/186rphc/the_nature_of_predators_172/)\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15) | [Becoming a Predator](https://www.patreon.com/posts/nature-of-1-90082904) | [Series wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_nature_of_predators) *|* [Official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqj4HkRdpw)", "Kia Stinger Production To End In April 2023: Report ", "[New Update Part 2] - AITA for jumping out of the way when my niece and nephew tried to push me into a pool, resulting in them falling in? **I am not the OOP.

Wrote most of this yesterday but decided to wait to post it until I wasn't so wound up. Waiting didn't work, I'm still wound up. Sorry if this rambles, so much has happened, hard to write coherently.\n\nThings have gone to hell. I really, truly did not think anything like this would happen.\n\nShort version: My brothers in law broke into my vacation home and were arrested. They've been charged with breaking and entering, destruction of property and communicating threats, all Class 1 misdemeanors. I've refused to drop the charges. I might do so if I'm fully paid for the damage they caused. They were still in jail as of Saturday evening, I assume they're out by now.\n\nThings had settled down, at least I thought so. Haven't seen or heard from my sisters in over six weeks. My parents went up to the house for a week and had a good time. David - the property manager I hired - has worked out great, he's done a couple of repairs I asked him to do and I've given him a list that he's going to work on. He usually sends a photo or two of wildlife or a sunset to his clients every week, was kind of making me want to get up there.\n\nFriday after Thanksgiving my BILs went to my vacation home. They used an angle grinder to cut through the chain on the driveway gate and damaged the gate in the process. They tried to get in through the front door, ruined the lockset and gouged the door badly. They finally got in through the utility floor door and a locked internal door. They also broke into the barn, I'm not sure why. When they went out through the front door where they were met by sheriff's deputies and David. David gets notifications from the camera system when there's activity, he saw what was going on and called the sheriff's department.\n\nAccording to David the BILs tried to bullshit their way out of it but the deputies didn't buy it. Breaking into an empty house is a pretty serious thing up there, usually it's meth heads who ransack the place and hock everything. When the BILs were arrested they freaked out big time, were saying how they were going to beat the hell out of me, etc... Not smart to do in front of cops.\n\nDavid and the sheriff's office tried calling my wife and me to see what we wanted to do but we were spending the day with her parents and had left our phones in the car so we could be in vacation mode. So they booked the BILs on everything, which is what I would have asked them to do anyway.\n\nBIL's called their wives from jail who of course freaked out; they called my folks, tried to call me (they're blocked), tried to find a lawyer up there to arrange bail (not easy to do given that it's a rural area and was a holiday weekend). Older sister has zero cash and her cards are maxxed out so if they made bail my middle sister would have had to pay for both husbands. I know they were still in jail as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe didn't check our phones until late Friday on the way home from the in laws. There were a ton of calls and messages from my mom, dad, David and the sheriff's department. Talk about ruining a great day, I was in such a good mood til I looked at my phone. My wife read through the texts and listened the messages, read them out to me and by the time we got home I had some idea of what was going on. I put my brain back into thinking mode, tried to get past my anger, failed. Called David and got the rundown on what had happened and how bad the damage was, resulting in more anger.\n\nI ended Friday by calling the sheriff's department and telling them there was no misunderstanding, the BILs had absolutely no right to be on my property and I wanted to press charges. I didn't call my folks back. Barely slept.\n\nI waited until Saturday afternoon to call my folks. They were both pretty rattled about it all, my mom in particular. My sisters had browbeat them into telling me I should tell the cops it was all a mistake and that I wanted the charges dropped. I refused flat out, told them there was no way I'd do that until I spoke with an attorney and also not until I was paid in full for whatever it will cost to fix everything 100%. My mom was crying hard by the time we got off the phone which of course made me feel like shit. My dad suggested it was time for a complete start over but also said he thought they needed to pay for the damage.\n\nI haven't gone up to the property yet. There's nothing I can do and I'll probably go nuts when I see the damage in person, the photos are bad enough. I'm hoping to tomorrow or Wednesday but my job isn't one I can just wander off from for non-emergencies.\n\nI've left messages with two attorney friends asking them to recommend the right lawyer(s) to go after my sisters and BILs. I don't know what I can do exactly but I'm hoping to get restraining orders (I have all the texts they've sent me, that might help). I'm strongly considering suing them for the money they made renting the place, I don't care about the cash but it will help make them as miserable as possible. The gloves are definitely off at this point.\n\nA couple of side notes:\n\nBILs had no idea I'd hired someone to keep an eye on things or that there are cameras there now. My parents knew but hadn't told them because they knew it would just give my sisters a reason to drama up. There are signs on the property stating it's being monitored with cameras and no trespassing signs though.\n\nMy wife has completely had it at this point. I don't blame her, she's been more than patient about it all but she reached her limit and was not shy about letting me know. She told me its up to me how I deal with this but that she thought they all needed to be taught a hard lesson.\n\nOlder BIL likely won't face any repercussions at his job over this but middle BIL has a security clearance so he might. I'm hoping that will be motivation for middle BIL to pay for the damages himself immediately.\n\nDavid (the caretaker) has an interesting background. I knew he was friends with some of the deputies, figured it was because they were all locals. I was wrong, he was a cop in a big city for years, was shot on duty and afterwards decided to quit and move to where his parents had retired. He has some PTSD over it all, his dog is a certified service animal and is usually with him. I know law enforcement people tend to hang together, I guess that's how they became his friend group.\n\nI don't want to see or speak with these Aholes for the rest of my life. I know this is in direct conflict with my overwhelming urge to make their lives as miserable as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The-Idle-Gamer**\n\n*Sorry this happened to you pal crappy situation all round but if you want a complete strangers opinion on Reddit I agree with your wife. Seems they won\u2019t take the hints so a lesson will have to be learned here. I know it will be a hard thing to have to go through family wise your sisters will get on at your parents and that will then get fed down to you, but your mum and dad bearing the weight of this isn\u2019t on, it\u2019s not their problem nor yours, your sisters and BILs made their bed and now they have to lie in it. Do you know why they even broke into the house yet? Was it to just prove a point? Some drunken plan they made or were they going to steal and mess the place up? Sending best wishes from across the pond you\u2019ll get through this.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP: A lot of people have said I should have been hard ass about all of this from day one. I've avoided it because it would have stressed out my parents and I hate this kind of drama but f it, they're stressed out now.  \n>  \n>My wife has pretty much opted out of any more to do with this, doesn't want to hear about it for a while and says it's in my lap. She'll ease off on that but I'm guessing she's not going to get involved from now on other than listening to me blow off steam.  \n>  \n>Edit: Regarding why they broke in - Conjecture on my part but I think they were planning on using it for family getaways and/or renting it out again. According to David (the property manager) it's deer season through the end of the year. I know the BILs have used it in the past as \"base camp\" for big group hunting weeks. It sleeps quite a few people so one event with friends could net them thousands of dollars. Again, I'm guessing here but that would explain why they broke into the barn as well, I bought a 6 seater Mule a few years back and they would want use that.  \n>  \n>I don't think they wanted to trash the place, it means too much to my dad and they both like him a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 6 - 1 week later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecember 2, 2023 (Saturday). Didn't think I'd be doing another post this soon but a lot has happened over the past two days. Short version: I think the corner has been turned on this crap.\n\nThursday afternoon I got a courier-delivered envelope at my office. In it was a signed letter from both my brothers-in-law and a cashier's check for $5000. In the letter they made what I have to say was a really sincere apology. Among other things they acknowledged breaking in, acknowledged it was wrong, said the $5000 was to pay for the damage and that they'd pay more if it cost more than that. Also said they'd stay away from the vacation home unless my wife and I specifically invited them. They also asked that I do what could to get the charges dropped as soon as possible because they both could lose their jobs and that they'd agree to a restraining order or whatever else it took for that to happen. There was more as well, all conciliatory, but that's the gist of it.\n\nTo say this was a shock is an understatement. It was (obviously) a total 180 from their past behavior.\n\nI'd already made an appointment with an attorney to see about suing my BILs over the damage and to try to get a restraining order. I called him and told him what I'd just received and he agreed to meet with me at the end of the day instead of next week. Told me not to deposit the check.\n\nWe met for about two hours. He ended up recommending the wife and I do a \"settlement and mutual release agreement\" with all four of them (sisters and BILs). He said if we went after them via a lawsuit that we'd almost certainly win but that it could take two years or more, there would be sizeable up front legal fees and that we might never see any money. He also said we could keep the $5000 free and clear even if we didn't let them off the hook. He's drawing up the agreement, it won't be ready until Monday. The agreement will include what's essentially the civil equivalent of a restraining order.\n\nI'd already asked my property manager to work up a bid to get the damage repaired. I called him after the meeting and asked that he get me as close an estimate as possible ASAP. Got that Friday, he thinks it will take around $4000 to fix everything. Most of that is for the front door.\n\nOn Friday my attorney contacted each of the BILs, told them what we were proposing and advised them to get their own lawyers. They both agreed to it. The middle BIL told him they could afford to either pay for the damages or pay for a lawyer but not both and they figured a lawyer wouldn't make any difference given that they really had no defense for what they did. His biggest concern was if the charges could be dropped. From what I can tell they're willing to do anything / sign anything to make this all go away.\n\nMy attorney also called the DA's office on Friday to discuss dismissing the charges, got the name of the prosecutor and left them a message but has not spoken to them yet. He thinks they'll dismiss the charges because the BILs are paying up and they have no priors, but then again he's not a criminal lawyer. Also said I should be prepared to drive up there Monday or Tuesday and tell the prosecutor in person that I want everything dismissed.\n\nHe's also advised me to continue to be no contact with sisters and BILs especially for the next six months and that it will be really important to follow the terms of the agreement when it comes to future interactions with them.\n\nI'm guessing that the BILs change of heart is due to them having figured out what's at stake for them, what it's going to cost them in legal fees and fines and so on. There's also the (highly unlikely) possibility that they could go to jail for up to 120 days, and as I've mentioned one of them has a security clearance for his job that could be at risk. So this is their Hail Mary pass to keep their normal lives.\n\nThis isn't a perfect resolution to the situation, but at least it will get me past the legal and financial parts of the shit show that I've been in for the past few months. I doubt I'll ever have a civil relationship with any of them ever again and that's fine. What I want most at this point is to close this off, get on with my life and never speak to any of them again. I'm exhausted from this. Wife feels pretty much the same way.\n\nKind of a side issue but getting the written apology was, weirdly, a huge moment for me. I wasn't expecting that ever but apparently it matters to me quite a bit. The money doesn't feel particularly important at this moment. I'll damn sure take it though.\n\nAlso I'm pretty certain my middle sister and her husband came up with the money. The cashier's check is from the credit union of the company he works for.\n\nOnce things are signed I plan to make one more update, probably just an edit to this post.\n\nI'm sorry for being so pedantic. Writing these posts has helped clear my head and the feedback has really helped. I truly appreciate everyone's comments, insights, and support. And I really, really hope none of you ever have to go this kind of nonsense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unwanted88**\n\n*This update is a Massive improvement. Make sure that they cannot contact you unless it is trough your lawyers also. They fked around and found out and now willing to do anything. Make sure your parents are in the loop about the proceedings also. That may help some overzealous entitled behaviour in the long run with your sisters. Sincerely O.P. your Saga is incredibly difficult to deal with and you are doing it like a Champ! You and your wife are Incredibly affected by this nonsense and you both deserve to be done with this. But keep us informed we all are rooting for you <3*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP: Thanks for your kind words. To be honest when I finally got home Thursday night I cried from relief thinking this might all be over. I'm not going to discuss the settlement with my folks until it's signed by everyone. My sisters / BILs can if they want to but I'm not, it's between me and them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 7 - 9 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecember 7, 2023 (Thursday)\n\nTuesday morning I met with my attorney went over the agreement. Changed a couple of minor things and he sent it to my sisters and brothers-in-law. It included a requirement that they pay my attorney's fee (about $3000). They weren't happy about that and tried to negotiate it away, but he told them they either accept it as is or there would be no deal at all and we'd proceed with suing them for the money they got from renting out the place, wear and tear from renting it, repair costs from their break in, emotional distress, lost income from having to deal with this, attorney fees and whatever else we could. He also told them I would push hard with the DA's office to prosecute every charge.\n\nShort version, they came in and signed. I wasn't there. I'm told it was a pretty tense environment, that the middle BIL appeared to have taken charge and that at one point he told both of my sisters to shut the hell up or he was walking away from the whole thing, making his own deal with us and the rest of them could all go to hell. They provided another cashier's check for $2500, claimed that's all they had. It's close enough that we're going to accept it as the final payment.\n\nAttorney also told me that everyone was very cold and curt towards one another, but that they all managed to keep it together long enough to sign and left without making too big of a scene.\n\nI drove up to the vacation house early yesterday to check out the damage and meet with the DA's office. Seeing the damage made my blood boil, it was so senseless. I was so pissed that I was ready to eat the cost of repairs and do everything I could to ruin their lives. Tried walking it off, failed utterly. Ended up calling a good friend who was kind enough to stay on the phone for over an hour letting me spew and vent. He eventually got me back to focusing on the bigger picture of putting this behind me and getting on with my life. Honestly I'm still not sure that's what I want to do but I settled down enough to get some food in me and I felt better.\n\nAfter lunch I went he DA's office. Hadn't made an appointment and had to wait a while but got to meet with the assistant DA who's got the case. Short version is that since I don't want to prosecute and the BILs have already paid for the damages that they are willing to drop all the charges except trespassing, which in this case will be a class 2 misdemeanor. The BILs will have to plead guilty and pay whatever fine the judge sets. I'm also told that if they fight the trespassing charge or ever so much as fart in public up there that it would go very poorly for them. It helped that the BILs didn't resist arrest, if they had none of the charges would have been dropped.\n\nI also went by the sheriff's office to thank them for getting there so quickly and everything. Wanted to thank the deputies personally but only spoke to the dispatch person. And I tried to meet up with David (the property manager) but couldn't get hold of him.\n\nA couple of notes: The agreement includes a no contact clause. Basically if any of them show up where my wife or I are (or the other way around) whoever got there last has to leave immediately. No contact except through attorneys or other \"mutually agreed upon third parties\". They get to keep whatever they made from renting the vacation house (my big \"give\") unless I have tax consequences which they will be responsible for. And we release each other from all other liabilities up through the present. There's more to it than that but those are the high points.\n\nWife and I will sign the agreement later today. After that I can't talk about most of this but I can talk around it.\n\nI think this is my final update regarding all this nonsense but I'll respond to comments if I can. As I've said before, posting about all of this and reading folks thoughts and responses has been really helpful and has probably been key in my being able to handle this in a relatively healthy way. So thank you all again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Free-Comb8184**\n\n*I have been following your story from the start and can\u2019t believe how this all turned out. Your sisters and their husbands basically destroyed your family over their selfishness and pettiness. I feel for your parents as they are now caught in the middle and can never have their family together again for anything because of their daughters and spouses being so selfish.*\n\n*I will say you are better than me because I would not have dropped the charges or made the agreement you did. They would have been sued by me especially after finding out they rented your vacation home without permission or considering the legality of it. I M usual a forgive and forget type of person but this went way too far for that.*\n\n*I am glad that the legal aspect of the situation is starting to get behind but unfortunately this will never end due to the family dynamics it has created. I hope your parents stay understanding with and your wife in this situation as they have been in your previous updates.*\n\n*Best of luck to you and I hope for you and your wife\u2019s sanity that this is coming to a close for you.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP:Thanks for the kind words. I had a hard time not being vindictive but right now I'm glad I wasn't. If they cause more drama down the road I'll probably regret it but if they follow the agreement that won't happen. The family dynamics are, like you said, pretty much f'd. I've only told my parents that we're trying to work things out, nothing more. They may or may not be OK with the way things will be moving forward but I had to do what was best for my wife and I. I'm guessing that my sisters have told them a very slanted version, that's just one more turd I'll have to swim around. Really the agreement is more a formalization of how things have been for the last few months. I know it's not how my folks wanted things to go but I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 8 (March 2024) - 3 months later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThought it would be worth an update for anyone who's interested.\n\nUnsurprisingly my oldest sister and brother in law have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. While I don't care about what happens to them financially or otherwise they've also managed to drag my parents into their mess, which I'm not happy about.\n\nAt the start of the year my BIL's oversized-customized-pride-and-joy truck was repossessed. Pretty embarrassing for him I'm sure, happened at work. This was their breaking point, without the truck they have to share a Kia my parents loaned them and they can barely fit in it with their three kids. Financially they're f'd. They owe at least $125K (probably more) on high interest credit cards, they have zero equity in their house, and have a couple of personal loans that I'm pretty certain they got under false pretenses. They have loans on their jet skis, ATVs and trailers. They also owe a chunk of money from defaulting on the truck lease.\n\nThey hadn't made any payments on their credit cards or loans in months and were behind on their house payments as well. They got out of the lease on my sister's massive SUV late last year. They were upside down on it as well so had to come up with cash to do so. They also had to pay an attorney, the fine and court costs for my BIL's trespassing charge at the vacation house. And they owe my middle sister and her husband money for bail and their portion of the damages to the place.\n\nAs I've mentioned before my folks have never been financial wizards, but they have at least been generally responsible. They're retired, their home is paid off and they live off of social security and pensions. Altogether they get more than they spend. Minimal savings, just an emergency fund. Turns out my folks emptied out that fund, cashed out their small IRA (\\~$20K) and gave it to my sister. That let her catch up on the house payment and cover the negative equity on her car lease. But now literally every bit of savings my parents possessed is gone. Plus my parents have been paying for their groceries for several months and continue to pay the insurance on the car they loaned my sister.\n\nAccording to my dad my sisters worked my mom for weeks to get her to fork over the money. They'd worked on both my folks at the same time for a while but my dad flat out refused every time. Eventually mom caved, she was worried that my sister would have to move to a hovel in some backwater town and that the kids would be barefoot and eating dirt. Dad's not happy about it, and to say there's some tension between them right now is an understatement. But they'll be fine.\n\nI was pretty disappointed when my parents told me all this but I wasn't surprised. It sucks that that they emptied out their savings to help but I kind of get it, the way the bankruptcy laws are in our state by getting caught up on the home loan my sister should be able to keep the house. I tried hard not to say how I felt about this and my sisters, mostly succeeded. Really I'm way more pissed about this than I should be.\n\nThe worst part for me is that my sister and BIL could now contact me and my wife without any real fear of repercussions. The only penalty the no contact agreement has is that if they violate it we can go after them for the money they made from renting out the vacation house and related damages. Since they've filed for bankruptcy that's now not an impediment for them. I'm hoping they'll leave us alone but who knows.\n\nFolks also told me that my middle sister and her husband have \"hit a rough spot\" and that he's not currently living with her and the kids. Just a guess but I imagine he's had it with the whole family dynamic that caused this nonsense.\n\nNot directly related, but on a brighter note I've spent two weekends at the mountain house since the start of the year, once with my wife and once alone. Both times there was a lot of snow. It was incredibly beautiful and relaxing. Very therapeutic. The place also has good Internet service now (thanks Starlink) which is nice. Plus knowing that I can count on David (the property manager) to keep the place in shape / ready for us to visit and to help if we get snowed in eliminates most of the stress in owning it. My folks have used it a few times as well and get along great with David.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Straysmom**\n\n*Well, Karma seems to be catching up with the wannabe Jones. I am really sorry that your sisters grifted your parents out of their savings. Unfortunately, they are adults & chose to cave to their daughters. Can you still get an RO for harassment with your older sister & BIL? They might not be bound by the signed agreement. But if they are calling, texting or emailing you & you don't want the contact, that might be enough to get an RO. Especially since there is already a record of BILs actions. I feel bad for you that your crazy sisters are continuing to cause mischief. Even if it isn't directly on you. It is still affecting you.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP:If they start up again I do indeed plan to get a restraining order. In fact my wife made it clear to me she expects a very hard approach to any BS from them going forward - which I agree with of course.  \n>  \n>I had the security cameras at our house upgraded at the start of the year just in case they come by. I also kept all their previous texts and provided screenshots to my attorney for safekeeping.  \n>  \n>If they cause any trouble at the vacation house they're toast, the sheriff's department and DA's office have the full story and are sympathetic to our situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Akira\\_Reviews**\n\n*In the event they lose their house, either they'll coerce your parents to move in with them, or demand you give your vacation house to them to live. This ordeal might not be over for you yet.*\n\n>OOP: Thankfully my folks live in an over 55 community so they can't move in there. Plus the house is not anywhere near large enough for seven people unless everybody stays in the \"great room\" all the time. And God knows where they'd park.  \n>  \n>Living in the vacation house isn't practical for them either, again something I'm happy about. With traffic it's probably three hours from there to my BIL's job. They'd have to have 4WD vehicles to live there year round too. Plus from what I understand the schools there are not very good (I'm being polite), and as much as I dislike my sister I'll say that she's all in on keeping her kids in good schools.  \n>  \n>They can afford their current house once they get through bankruptcy, assuming they change how they spend. I think they'll have to, no one in their right mind would lend them money or give them a credit card. The won't be able to take fancy vacations or swap out his truck every couple of years for an even bigger one (yeah, I admit, that goddamn truck fetish of his really bugs me) but they'll live just fine. It's not like a family of five is going to suffer when they're taking in close to $200K per year. Hopefully I'm not being Pollyannaish about all this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Swiss\\_Miss\\_77**\n\n*Not paying the mortgage but letting the truck get repo'd. They should have SOLD IT or given it back first and they should have given up all the toys MONTHS ago. Instead they just kept doubling and tripling down...absolutely insane levels of entitlement and delusion.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP:To be fair (and this is according to my parents) they tried to sell the ATVs and watercraft. But the value on those things drop like a rock the moment you buy them and they were upside down on the loans. So they eventually just quit paying on them.  \n>  \n>Also this reminds me - when they broke into the vacation house they also broke into the mini barn. Turns out my older BIL had stowed his two ATVs in it. Just guessing but I think he was going to take them, report them stolen, get an insurance settlement and sell them on the sly.  \n>  \n>(I found out the ATVs were there and paid to have them taken to my dad's place; he had my BIL pick them up from there.)  \n>  \n>Also, I don't think my BIL was expecting the truck to repo'd. I think he was working to catch up on the payments so they'd have one good vehicle. The finance company must have just run out of patience. Don't blame them, he's a fuck up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Happy\\_Connection5509**\n\n*They must have been making quite a packet from their fraudulent vacation home income for it to impact their finances to this extent.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OOP:I think they were grossing at least $50K per year, probably more. Tax free, it was never listed on Airbnb as far as I can tell, they'd rent to friends, friends of friends, etc.  \n>  \n>I base the $50K on the fact that my parents kept a calendar for the house to keep track of who was using the place. I went through the last three years worth of calendars and my sisters were using the place a lot, sometimes for a week at a time. Supposedly they were doing school related planning retreats as well as just family time. I know similar places go for $2000 (or more) per weekend and at least $4000 for a week. It can sleep 6 people in bedrooms and has a bunk room for kids that all 5 would stay in. Plus it has two queen size pull out sofas. If you pushed it you could fit more people than that.  \n>  \n>I think my sisters are just spendaholics. They constantly have the newest whatever - iPads, TVs, clothes, diets, you name it. So no matter how much they got they'd spend more. So this was going to happen eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New Update - 4 months later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**July 2024 Update**\n\nThere's been a fair number of requests for an update and considering it's coming up on the one year anniversary of the pool incident I thought I'd post one.\n\nMy folks worked through Mom giving my oldest sister her IRA and their emergency fund. Altogether Mom gave her $45K. According to Dad once Mom realized how much she'd been manipulated she got as mad and upset as he'd ever seen her. I think she had a \"moment of clarity\". She and Dad ended up calling my sisters on a three way call and according to Dad it went south pretty quickly. Sisters were gaslighting them, Mom lost her cool and ended up ripping into them hard, there were lots of tears and eventually both sisters hung up. Mom really just wanted both sisters to acknowledge that they'd put her and Dad in a risky financial situation. Typical blowup I guess, but not the kind of thing that happens in our family.\n\nThe next morning my dad called my older sister and told her he'd be picking up the car they'd loaned her. She tried to argue but he told her it wasn't up for discussion. He got a neighbor friend to take him to her house as soon as he hung up and drove it home without talking to her. Sister called and went off on him, said lots of nasty stuff, which of course hurt him. But at least they have the car back.\n\nDad also told me something that left me dumbfounded. For the last 17 years they were giving both sisters a \"grocery allowance\" that was up to $500 per month. What the F'ing F? I'd thought I had a pretty good handle on where their money was going but clearly I was wrong. This started back when I was going to grad school and living at home. My sisters asked for the money because they thought it wasn't fair that I was living at home rent free, and then it just never ended. In any case my parents cut them off. Unsurprisingly my sisters weren't happy about it. Who the hell gets an allowance from their parents when they're in their 40's?\n\nBecause of all this my folks and sisters quit talking for a while. Don't know if they've resolved everything but they appear to be on speaking terms again, though my folks aren't having them or the kids over. I'm in \"don't ask\" mode, it's their business.\n\nMy folks are using the vacation home fairly regularly. Currently they're there for a two week stay and will probably make it three. Unfortunately my wife and I haven't spent any time there lately other than me having made a couple of day trips to check on it and drop off some supplies. The property manager I hired (David) is still taking good care of the place.\n\nSide note: Middle sister told my mom that the oldest sister had been making over $6000 per month renting the house out and that it had been going on for nearly three years. Pretty certain she didn't declare the income, so that's like grossing $8K - $9K per month. I will forever find that galling.\n\nOldest sister and BIL still have their house. My attorney checked up on their bankruptcy case, the court converted it from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 which I believe means they have to pay back a lot more of their debts.\n\nMiddle sister and her husband are still separated. I don't know if my middle BIL has had any issues with his security clearance because of breaking into the house. I do know he's still with the same big defense company.\n\nAt my parents request I've been working on putting their house into a trust. They want me to manage their affairs as they get older and keep the house safe from my sisters. I'm working with an attorney but it's not done yet. Folks have asked me to be the trustee and have also given me full power of attorney.\n\nThe best part about the last few months is that my sisters / BIL's have left us alone and have stayed away from the vacation home. Wife and I are really happy to be back to our normal lives.\n\nHope everyone else's lives are going great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Turrambers**\n\n*Seems things worked out besides your mother's retirement. I'm glad you've got your normal life back and that your mother saw the light. Thank you for the update!*\n\n>OOP: The folks have actually started saving again. They were already spending less than they get each month and they're also saving the $1000 they'd been giving my sisters each month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**miyuki\\_m**\n\n*Every time you add new info about your sisters, the more I dislike them.*\n\n>OOP: Yeah... every time I write one of these updates I do too.

One of their ongoing things is volunteering for Meals for Wheels. That's actually why they have the Kia, they bought it from an older neighbor who'd driven it for the program for years, it fits just the right amount of insulated boxes for a couple of people to distribute in a few hours.

Today, marketing activities are influenced by globalization and internalization of business, new legal rules, and regulations, consumer values, and demands.\n\n## Company and Industry Background\n\nThe automotive industry is one of the leading industries in the world. The automotive industry aims to maintain the level of service and product quality and develop strategies to improve its products/services. Ford was established in 1903 as a converted factory. In a century, the company becomes the second-largest automaker in the USA. Today, Ford employs 283,000 employees and operates more than 100 factories around the globe. Its market share in the US auto market is about 17.7%. The market leader is General Motors with about 24.6% of the market share. Ford produces all types of passenger vehicles and trucks. A special offering involves Touring cars, Rally, Sports Cars, busses, tractors, etc. In general, Ford is well-positioned in the market to take on this important global leadership role. It has the global resources and certainly has the technological capability (Ford Home Page, 2007).\n\n## Marketing Perspectives\n\nAccording to the Annual Report (2006), the company provides a successful marketing activity that allows it to earn $12,613 M (net income). From the report, it is evident that the goal of the company is to provide the opportunity to personalize purchases. In this case, the Internet and e-commerce create great opportunities for the automotive industry (and customers) to hasten the process of purchase. Ford underlines that \u201cgrowth in wholesales (i.e., volume) will be greatest in emerging markets in the next decade, we expect that the mature automotive markets (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and Japan) will continue to be the source of a majority of global industry revenues\u201d (Annual Report, 2006). An overall business strategy, potential, and capability to support high-performance environments are the key elements for the next years. The policy of safety adopted by Ford is the main strategic criteria. Technological forces generate problem-solving inventions. Ford target is on average as dependent on reliable innovations and technology as any other business (Crawford 2003).\n\nTo resist competition, Ford uses marketing to increase customer loyalty and commitment. \u201cWe expect, however, that a decline in or the inability to increase vehicle prices could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to purchase over time higher-end, more expensive vehicles and/or vehicles with more features\u201d (Annual Report, 2006). Ford has several options for addressing the problem of price competition. The choices are dic\u00adtated in part by product and market competition. In North America, Ford is forced to switch to offshore sourcing of certain components to keep costs and prices competitive. In particular, the Far East and Asia are emerging as attractive markets for Ford. The specification in Ford is determined as a result of an organization\u2019s policy. This is the process of designing quality into the service. Sales strategy is on a one-to-one basis (Kotler and Armstrong, 2005).\n\n## Marketing and Competitive Advantage\n\nThe auto market is not in maturity one, and today it offers a limited opportunity for high profits, so it sets about developing products that are both distinc\u00adtive and could be sold at a premium price. A specialized product range necessitates a clear identification of the target market (Kotler and Armstrong 2005). The original mission of the company makes it clear that it is in the relatively unexploited \u2018 sector that allows the opportunity for innovation. Ford sets out to create a range of high-quality products that are distinctive in shape and price (Ford Home Page, 2007).\n\n## Environmental Laws and their Impact on Ford\n\nCurrent environmental laws and regulations become a real threat fro Ford and its market position. Many European countries and the USA require that automakers improve their technologies and reduce gas emissions. These policies force companies like Ford to spend millions of dollars on R&D and new production methods. The main research trends are hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol on global warming requires ecologically safe solutions (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007).\n\n## Competitive Advantage\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry, we can help!

Porter, a company creates a competitive advantage if the earnings of the company exceed their costs (Kotler and Armstrong 2005). It is possible to say that Ford has a competitive advantage in the industry introducing new products and unique services for potential consumers. New product development will open new markets for Ford and allows attract a new target audience. Ford becomes more market-focused than less successful firms in selecting opportunities for product development, and in creating products to market needs (Annual Report, 2006). It also concentrates on developing products that build on core competencies and skills. Today, Ford is good at communicating the desirability and requirements of product development internally to avoid the disruptions that new developments can bring. So, a new conceptually new car is the market need and Ford can be the first company which starts its manufacturing (Crawford, 2003).\n\nThe strategy towards a hydrogen car is the main priority of the company today to compete in the future. Conceptually new Car is the future of the industry. For Ford, consolidation in its present products presents adequate opportunities and requires a search for alternatives that build upon the company\u2019s present knowledge and skills. In the case of product development, Ford will maintain the security of its present markets while changing prod\u00aducts or developing new ones (Ford Home Page 2007). Another strategy concerns existing products. In the case of Asian market development, Ford maintains the security of its present products while venturing into new market areas. Asian market development can include entering Indian and South Korean, China markets exploiting new uses for the product or spreading into new geographical areas. Of course, market development and product development may go hand in hand, since the move into a new market segment may require developments of variants to the existing product range.\n\n\u201cAs part of our acceleration of the Way Forward plan, 70 percent of Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury products (by volume) in North America will be new or significantly upgraded by the end of 2008 compared with 2006 models; these efforts will include the expansion of our product lineup in growth segments such as crossover vehicles\u201d (Annual Report, 2006).\n\nSuperiority over competitors is achieved through a differentiation and cost leadership strategy..Price competition supported by improved quality, is likely to feature highly as it fights for survival in markets faced with over-capacity. Within a rapidly changing environment, this kind of development ensures that a company will survive. the main priority of Ford is to satisfy consumer needs and adapt to the new competitive environment. Branding, advertising, promotion, and additional services to customers and product innovation strengthen Ford\u2019s image. The value proposition is based on the idea that Ford\u2019s products meet the needs of diverse customer targets proposing high quality and low cost (Annual Report, 2006)\n\n## Segmentation and Positioning\n\nFord chooses to position its products using a personalization strategy. This strategy helps the company to appeal to the consumers\u2019 minds with offer\u00adings. Positioning of the brand can be characterized by establishing trustworthiness, confidence, and competence for customers. This strategy is supported by the buying process and the pricing. Also, the positioning strategy of Ford helps the customers to have the product within their minds. To address the target market Ford creates customers\u2019 trust to make them willingly follow the company. Ford positions itself as \u2018a save the car for the whole family. It teaches consumers that safety is the main criterion when choosing a new car. Also, it appeals to consumers with low prices and high quality of its products (Kotler and Armstrong 2005; Ford Motor Company Press Releases 2007).\n\nTo name the target group, Ford identifies groups of consumers with similar wants and needs. In general, targeting is the act of evaluating and comparing the identified groups and then selecting one or more of them as the prospect with the highest potential. A marketing mix is then devised that will pro\u00advide the organization with the best return on sales while simultaneously creating the maximum amount of value to consumers (Annual Report 2006). As Ford wants to penetrate an existing market, it must offer more value than competitors\u2014better benefits and lower prices. It should utilize three basic criteria for assessing opportunity in target markets: current size of the segment and anticipated growth potential, competition, and compatibility with the company\u2019s overall objectives, and the feasibility of successfully reaching a designated target.\n\nSegmentation will be used to understand individual customers in the sports marketplace and to group them to form distinct segments which are identifiable, accessible, and substantial. At its simplest, a consumer segmentation may be Non-user, Competitor\u2019s customer, Low-value customer, High-value customer (Fill 1999). From the geo-demographic, Ford is oriented on all ages and both gender. The majority of its customers belong to the low and middle classes. Its sales cover all geographical locations. Lifestyle allows determining how customers live: the core of the customer group is blue-collar workers. Ford\u2019s customers value innovation and quality but prefer to buy a safe and \u2018cheap\u2019 car.\n\nPorter\u2019s 4P\u2019s involve product, place, promotion, and price. Pricing The unique market pricing strategy is a part of deliberate attempts to reach a global market segment that is willing to buy a particular product. Ford calls its pricing strategy True Blue Pricing which allows: \u201cbetter reflect final selling prices, lowering the sticker prices on most 2006 model year vehicles\u201d (). This pricing strategy is appropriate in the introductory phase of the product life cycle when both production capacity and competition are limited. By setting a deliberately high price, demand is limited to innovators and early adopters who are willing and able to pay the price. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell on the strength of our products rather the amount of the incentive,\u201d said Steve Lyons, group vice president, North American Marketing, Sales and Service. \u201cWith a strong, fresh product lineup we are best positioned to take advantage of this pricing strategy\u201d (Hewett 2007).\n\nUnique product design and image attract millions of consumers and help the company to create its brand image. All its products have a perceived uniqueness in a broad mar\u00adket. This is an extremely effec\u00adtive strategy for defending market position and obtaining above-average finan\u00adcial returns; unique products often command a premium price. This marketing strategy helps to deliver customer value in a way that clearly distinguishes the product from its competitors. The recent new products are Lincoln MKX, Ford Expedition, and Lincoln Navigator in North America; Ford S-MAX, Ford Galaxy, and Ford Transit in Europe; Jaguar XK, Land Rover Freelander 2/LR2, Volvo S80, and Volvo C30, and Mazda CX-9 (Annual report 2006). Place Ford sells its products through dealers. This channel offers variety but it is focused on a marketing mix aimed at all target markets. Promotion Using a mar\u00adket development strategy, Ford captures a larger share of a market for current products through market saturation and market pene\u00adtration. The aim is to seek to create committed customers, not customers who are \u2018locked in\u2019. To develop a strong brand image and appeal to consumers, Ford uses service-based loyalty, incentive programs, and customer loyalty programs. Incentive programs involve immediate benefit promotions when the consumer reward for purchasing is immediate, and, as with most incentives, the sooner the reward can be expected and received after the qualifying action, the greater will be the positive effects of that incentive in stimulating purchase action. Included in this promotion category are price reductions; gifts. Customer loyalty programs include a rewards program for healthcare centers buying 10 phones for their patients. Marketing Communication strategy is based on online and offline advertising and promotion. The informative website is the top priority for Ford. On the one hand, it helps the company to sustain its brand image and deliver better services to customers (Crawford, 2003).\n\n## Demographics\n\nThe appointment of the new CEO, Allan Mulally, in 2006 has marked a new era in the company\u2019s growth. Allan Mulally plans to develop a new market of plug-in hybrids. In 2007, the company launches a new campaign aimed to investigate the market position. Rationalization may include selecting new intermediaries, assigning new responsi\u00adbilities to old intermediaries, or establishing direct marketing operations. Strategic moves are made towards new technology achievements and safety (Fill, 1999). In general, Ford has a great impact on the world\u2019s auto market creating a new culture of low-cost safe vehicles affordable for millions of people. The goal of the company is \u201cto build more of the products that people really want and value. Exciting new products that reflect the needs of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s customers, with striking designs that are safer, more fuel efficient and offer even greater value\u201d (Annual Report 2006). Ford\u2019s strategy processes satisfy the requirements of diverse customer groups. Thus, the company is criticized for its current strategies and policies. \u201cThe Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) deemed the ad for the Focus Zetec \u201cmisleading\u201d through its use of footage from the film, which featured the manufacturer\u2019s Mondeo model\u201d (Ford Motors Criticized, 2007). Also, Ford is often criticized for its great cultural impact and cultural change in Asian and African countries (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007).\n\nThrough its local production facilities, Ford makes an impact on the economy as most countries feel a lack of equal access to the world\u2019s material assets, including technological resources, and there is less linkage between urbanization and industry \u2013 an informal economy often predominates, and the spatial segregation is overlaid by ethnicity, caste, religion, and language. Meanwhile, a dispersal of pro\u00adductive wealth is underway as global corporations establish operations in key developing countries like Brazil and China. Many economists agree that this dis\u00adpersal will narrow the gap between poor and rich nations. Back in the industrialized nations, however, there is an increasing sense of social distress as work\u00aders see their plants close and jobs shipped out of the country (Ford Motor Company Press Releases, 2007). In addition, the globalization of industries such as steel, automobiles, and consumer electronics has cre\u00adated surplus production capacity on a massive scale. The existence and importance of large players with room for strategic decisions about trade, FDI, foreign production, and technology transfers must be accounted for in analyses of economic globalization.\n\n## References\n\n\n\nIf you're feeling stuck or need expert assistance, there\u2019s a solution!

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry\u2019s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.\n\nAuto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.\n\nStill, challenges are mounting\u2014particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries\u2014and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.\n\n\u201cPeople involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. \u201cThat silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it\u2019s the trend so they can\u2019t speak out loudly.\u201d\n\nWhile major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.\n\n\u201cBecause the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn\u2019t limit ourselves to just one option,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials\u2014an effort he described as tiring at times.\n\nGlobal car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.\n\nTraditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.\n\nAt the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.\n\nAnd their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.\n\nThe infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.\n\nAccording to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.\n\nBut that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.\n\nAuto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.\n\n\u201cThe coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that\u2019s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,\u201d said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren\u2019t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.\n\nRyan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.\n\nThat might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. \u201cIs there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,\u201d Mr. Gremore said.\n\nMr. Toyoda\u2019s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.\n\nMazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn\u2019t want.\n\nNissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.\n\nNissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.\n\nThe wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. \u201cWould that be enough? The answer is it may not be,\u201d Mr. Uchida said.\n\nMr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren\u2019t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. \u201cIt\u2019s about what can be done now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Toyoda\u2019s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.\n\nToyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.\n\nMr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.\n\nThe Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-president-says-silent-majority-has-doubts-about-pursuing-only-evs-11671372223?mod=hp_lead_pos5", "Say the line, Bart ", "Mazda RX-7 (FD) with a 6 rotor engine, sounds crazy!

Instead, this service uses the same credentials you already use to log in to iRacing and the iRacing Forums.\n* Whenever you launch iRacing while we are down for maintenance, you may now connect to Demo Drive, which lets you drive any content that is on your machine, so long as it\u2019s up to date.\n* \\- - Select a Car, Track, Display mode, and start driving!\n* When we leave maintenance mode, Demo Drive will remain running for a period of time and a countdown will appear to let members know how long it will remain up. Navigation links to and from Demo Drive will be available in iRacing when Demo Drive is available.\n* As with the Test Drive Service before it, newly released content will not be available in Demo Drive until the following Season.\n\n\n\n# Season Recap\n\n* A new \u201cRecaps\u201d tab has been added to the Profile Page of iRacing!\n* \\- - Here, you can see a customized recap of your performance stats for the previous season and year on iRacing. This new feature houses the season recaps that were previously emailed to Members, with the addition of new yearly recaps!\n* \\- - You can also view your Recaps in the Companion App, via a new Recap section on the Profile Page!\n\n\n\n# Settings\n\n* We have redesigned the Settings page to enhance usability and organization. The Settings are now available on a dedicated full-page interface instead of a modal window. This update introduces a tabbed layout with clearly defined sections: General, Preferences, Network, and About.\n* \\- - General: Manage basic account settings and display options.\n* \\- - Preferences: Customize your user experience with personalized settings.\n* \\- - Network: Configure connectivity and data-related options.\n* \\- - About: Access information about the application, including version details and support resources.\n\n\n\n# Results & Stats\n\n* Fixed an issue where the Driver Standings page could show a different License Class than the driver\u2019s profile page.\n\n\n\n# Paint Shop\n\n* DOF Reality paint shop sponsor logo has been updated.\n\n\n\n# Protests\n\n* A new entry has been added to the Protest Violations list: Unsafe Rejoin.\n\n\n\n# Sporting Code\n\n* A variety of Sporting Code changes and updates have been made including: better defined the coverage of the iRacing Official Sporting Code, updated and improved all references to penalties and their types, added sections describing the Pace Car and Rallycross Racing, several new Glossary terms have been added, internal document links have been fixed, and a new protestable offense, Unsafe Rejoin, has been added.\n\n\n\n# Legacy Membersite\n\n* Endpoints on the Legacy Membersite that have been available for scraping data will cease to function on March 11, 2025 (2025 Season 2 Release).\n* All 3rd parties are expected to be using the endpoints available in the /data API.

This solves an issue that could occur where drivers with poor connections could have their cars exert excessive forces when their position in the world was updated.\n\n\n\n# Dynamic Track\n\n* The dynamic track debris system has received an overhaul, adding new types of debris, improving their physics properties, upgrading their appearance, and vastly improving how debris is generated and moves around the track over time.\n* Gravel has been added as a new Dynamic Track debris type. Gravel can be found on a variety of off-track surfaces and reduces tire grip on racing surfaces.\n* Mud has been added as a new Dynamic Track debris type. Mud is generated when tires tear up the grass, and behaves like a mix of dirt and water.\n* The grip adjustments and physics behaviors applied by the various Dynamic Track debris types have been fine-tuned by science.\n* Dynamic Track debris accumulation and dispersion algorithms have been improved, with far superior tracking and accuracy for the amounts and locations of all debris of all types everywhere in the world.\n* Dynamic Track debris pick-up and throw logic and parameters for tires of various constructions have been updated.\n* Debris of all types can now be held on the car body itself, instead of only tires, and it may be shed based on velocity changes.\n\n* Adjusted the amount of debris picked up by tires based on the wetness of the track, tire, and debris type.\n* Aerodynamic effects pick-up and move track debris.\n\n* Improved the textures and rendering of all Dynamic Track debris types to make them easier to see, especially at a distance. This includes rubber marbles, dirt, dust, grass, mud, and gravel.\n* Pit crews have been trained to sweep their pit stalls at the start of Sessions - no debris begins in pit stalls.\n\n\n\n# iRacing Weather System\n\n* The Formula Vee has had its tires updated, and is now ready for wet racing!\n* ALL FIVE new cars come with a set of rain tires in addition to their normal racing tires. Don\u2019t forget to swap if the weather is looking grim!\n* \\- - Acura NSX GT3 EVO 22\n* \\- - BMW M2 CSR\n* \\- - Ferrari 499P\n* \\- - Supercars Chevrolet Camaro Gen 3\n* \\- - Supercars Ford Mustang Gen 3\n* Improved the precision for handling the start and end times for Sessions within an event, and carrying the weather and water states through the simulated intervening time to the next Session.\n* Water spray will now interact with discarded vehicle parts.\n* Updated a fix for an older issue where water levels were re-rendering whenever a camera approached - causing the shape and level of the water to constantly morph or flicker.\n* The effects of evaporation on temperature before an event begins have been updated. Now, even with static weather or at dirt tracks, moisture and track temperatures are more accurate.\n* Fixed an issue that could occur at Oval tracks using Timeline Mode Weather where local rain was not correctly forbidden to fall during sessions if the \u201cNo Rain\u201d option was enabled. This was traced back to a regional vs national weather governance dispute which our lawyers handled brilliantly.\n\n\n\n# Race Control\n\n* Cautions are now disallowed if the White Flag has been raised.\n* \\- - This fixes an issue where Automatic Full Course Yellow can be thrown after the leader starts their white flag lap.\n* \\- - This fixes an issue where a Yellow Flag can be thrown on GWC (Green/White/Checker) restart if a crash occurs before the Start/Finish line.\n* For Dirt Ovals with pitting enabled, and for Asphalt Ovals of size one mile, medium, and short, lapped cars are now allowed to pit with leaders during cautions, reducing caution sequence by a lap.\n* \\- - This has been done as part of trying to reduce the length of caution race restarts. These changes were originally done for longer ovals in 2020 and have been positively received.\n* \\- The new BMW M2 CSR has been enabled as a new pace car that you may select for Fred, Flawless Wheelman,\u00a0 to drive!\n* Fixed an issue where drivers could get penalized for passing other drivers and/or Fred's Pace Car under yellow after the race had ended.\n* Fixed an issue where drivers were unable to serve Drive-Through Penalties on the final lap before getting disqualified.\n* Fixed an issue with Do Not Count (DNC) Caution Laps where the 2nd place driver was given the lead on consecutive cautions.\n* Fixed an issue where drivers could slowly creep forward on Standing Starts without receiving a Jump Start penalty.\n* Fixed an issue where Barney would never throw the green flag if all drivers elected to start from the pits. These were very unexciting races.\n* Fixed an issue where Fred, Flawless Wheelman, would drive the Pace Car down pit road before the race was over during a Green/White/Checker finish.\n\n\n\n# Dirt Racing\n\n* The initial bumpiness of dirt oval racing surfaces has been reduced slightly.\n\n\n\n# AI Racing\n\n* AI Racing now allows for up to 16 car models to be used in a single Session.\n* AI Drivers have been trained in the ancient art of headlight flashing when preparing to make a pass. If you\u2019re in their way, they\u2019ll let you know!\n* AI Drivers have gained a greater awareness of their vehicle positioning, and will now be assessed incident points for \"Out of Control\" or \"Running Off Track\", just like their human counterparts.\n* AI Drivers are now fully versed in the following content:\n* \\- - Acura NSX GT3 EVO 22\n* \\- - BMW M2 CSR\n* \\- - Ferrari 499P\n* \\- - Supercars Chevrolet Camaro Gen 3\n* \\- - Supercars Ford Mustang Gen 3\n* \\- - Williams FW31\n* \\- - New Hampshire Motor Speedway - Road Course\n* \\- - New Hampshire Motor Speedway - Road Course with North Oval\n* \\- - Thruxton Circuit\n* Several AI Vehicles have received updates which improve their tire temperature modeling, making them far more accurate and comparable to a player-driven car. This improves AI Drivers\u2019 accuracy and performance, especially at extreme temperatures. The cars receiving this upgrade this Season include:\n* \\- - GTP Class Cars\n* \\- - Dallara P217\n* \\- - Ferrari 499P\n* \\- - Global Mazda MX-5\n* \\- - Late Model Stock\n* \\- - Lotus 79\n* \\- - NASCAR Trucks Series Class Trucks\n* \\- - SCCA Spec Racer Ford\n* \\- - Street Stock Class Cars\n* The Autumn 2024 Sessions for AI Driver School have come to a close.

The top graduate projects and presentations included the following:\n* \\- - Headlight Flashing Through the Ages - An Evolutionary Behavior Symposium\n* \\- - Taking Control of Your Life and Your Car with special guest car KITT\n* \\- - Underutilized Racing Tactics: Passing on the Apron\n* \\- - A Geological Analysis of Loose Racing Surfaces\n* \\- - Learning from Nature: Observe Turtles Recovering from 180\u00b0 Rolls\n* \\- - Accepting Hopelessness & Despair, and Knowing When to Reset!\n\n* \\- - Next Semester Sign-Ups - Host a Foreign Exchange Student from Microsoft AI\n* AI Drivers have completed some special focus training, improving their skill, lines, rain racing-ability, performance, and more with the following additional content:\n* \\- - GT3 Class Cars\n* \\- - Atlanta Motor Speedway\n* \\- - Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours\n* \\- - Circuit Zolder\n* \\- - Lime Rock Park\n* \\- - MotorLand Arag\u00f3n\n* \\- - New Hampshire Motor Speedway\n* \\- - Slinger Speedway - Oval\n\n* Fixed an issue in Multi-Class AI Racing where the player\u2019s grid position could be incorrect.\n\n\n\n# Spotter\n\n* The Spotter has audited some of the AI Driver School classes, and has become more versed in racing knowledge. He will use this new found know-how to better inform you of the damage state of your car, and how that damage may impact your driving ability. This includes the following new spotter calls and updated calls:\n* \\- - Engine Damage: Engine power losses including slight, severe, and totalled.\n* \\- - Aerodynamic Damage: Top speed reduction, downforce reduction, and oversteer or understeer effects.\n* \\- - Wheel Damage: Grip reduction, and wheel alignment changes.\n* \\- - These new messages will only play if the spotter chattiness is set to \"high\". Some of the existing messages about damage have been moved from \"high\" to \"medium\" chattiness.\n* These new messages about how damage affects your driving will also play during a requested damage report.\n* Spanish language Spotter Pack has been updated, thanks to Ari Cejas!\n* Italian language Spotter Pack has been updated, thanks to Renzo A. Olivieri!\n* Italian language Spotter Pack has been updated, thanks to Marco Arcidiacono!\n\n\n\n# Pit Stop\n\n* The Auto Fuel system has been added to all cars that were missing it. Some vehicles do not have Auto Fuel either by design or for other reasons, including:\n* \\- - Dirt Oval Cars (do not refuel)\n* \\- - McLaren MP4-30 (by design)\n* \\- - Mercedes-AMG W12 E Performance (by design)\n* \\- - Mercedes-AMG W13 E Performance (by design)\n* \\- - Porsche Mission R (it\u2019s electric!)\n* \\- - Super Formula SF23 (by design)\n\n* Fixed an issue where fuel fill amounts were sometimes silently modified during driver swaps.\n\n\n\n# Graphics\n\n* Greatly improved the specular (reflectivity) rendering for all objects in the simulation, providing greater color value and reducing a white-washing effect that could occur.\n* \\- - This was a long-standing graphics issue where specular maps were essentially \u201cdouble-exposed\u201d by the sun in cubemaps, causing some blown-out, white-wash, or a milky tone in many textures. This also fixes an issue where you could see the sun in reflections on surfaces that were completely in shadow where there should be no sun visible. Specular rendering is now much more realistic, with a greater range of intensity available.\n* Dynamic Track Rendering is now always enabled within the simulator to ensure the proper experience with rain and track debris.\n* \\- - Low Shaders are now available to be used at all times as they are not dependent on Dynamic Track Rendering being enabled.\n* The graphics options for Anti-Aliasing have been updated to be more intuitive. Anti-Aliasing (AA) options include: Off, FXAA, SMAA, and MSAA. Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) has its own sub-set of graphics options. Each of these settings are now orange to convey a Simulation restart is required for these changes to take effect.\n* Higher quality filtering-options have been added for MSAA. These filters consider a larger number of MSAA-samples, to improve quality without increasing cost during geometry rendering. Filtered MSAAx2 should in most cases match the old MSAAx4. Options available include: 2x, 4x, and 8x. Sharpness of the filter can be tweaked using the new filter-options, Simple, Soft, Neutral, and Sharp. The legacy option is available as the Simple filter.\n* Settings for Anisotropic Texture Filtering have been removed. They now always use x16.\n* A new entry \u201cAutoNoDynEmptyLOD=1\u201d has been added to the \u201crendererDX11.ini\u201d file. This allows objects to utilize a lower Level-of-Detail (LOD) model if needed when dynamic LODs kick in.\n* Debris rendering has been reworked to improve visibility at all distances.\n* Tonemapping has been improved to better match the format expected by non-HDR monitors. This removes a milky look that was particularly noticeable at night.\n* Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) has been heavily optimized.\n* Sky-rendering has been updated to improve effective resolution.\n* The distortion effect of water shaders is now reduced if the water is more shallow.\n* PopcornFX version has been updated.\n* Fixed an issue where we were filtering lighting in our cubemap as well as downsampling.\n* Fixed an issue where specular maps (and their effects) were not being rendered in mirrors.\n* Fixed several issues with the Graphics and Replay Options, especially with how the performance class sliders function, where the selection could sometimes not change when dragged, or it was getting reset after restarting the Simulator.\n\n* Fixed an issue where some particles were appearing near the camera instead of wherever they should have been appearing.\n\n* Fixed an issue with some screen space reflection shaders, especially for rain, that were not properly supporting single pass stereo for VR nor MVP/SMP for triples.\n\n* Fixed an issue in cloud-rendering that was causing clear skies to not be as clear as they should be.\n* Fixed an issue that could cause odd lighting of crowds.\n* Fixed an issue causing SSAO to not be applied on trees.\n\n\n\n# Audio\n\n* Audio spatial separation has been optimized for cockpit view cameras.\n* \\- - The in-car stereo and surround sound array now has been improved, with a wider soundstage to allow for a truer representation of our sound recordings which are largely done in 360 or binaural formats. This enhances realism and your driving auditory experience for all sound systems ranging from headsets, to stereo speakers, to surround sound systems.\n* All members now have the audio API set to XAudio.\n* \\- - If it is necessary, Direct Sound can still be used by setting it in the \u201capp.ini\u201d file. After running the Simulator, in the \u201capp.ini\u201d file, \"devSpeakerAPI\" becomes \"devSpeakerAPISelect\" with a value of 2. If you need to use DirectSound for your hardware to function, change this value to 1.\n* A volume slider has been added to the Replay Options menu to control the volume in Replay.\n* Curb sounds at high speeds for cameras inside the cockpit have been improved.\n* Fixed an issue where a code clock-smash could be triggered whenever any audio device properties were changed.\n* Fixed a rare issue where XAudio2 crashes.\n\n\n\n# Replay\n\n* Updated the processing for Replays that were captured with vehicles still using the Original Damage Model.\n* Fixed an issue where the Replay camera could violently shake.\n\n\n\n# Controls\n\n* For all stockcars, force feedback should now stay smooth without large spikes when driving at about 25 mph.\n\n\n\n", "Dendro Archon Theory | Possible reasons why Kusanali is not a Dendro Archon citing Zoroastrianism and other suspicious facts With this theory, I want to summarize all the previously found assumptions regarding Kusanali and Dendro Archon, and also share my own findings in this theory (although you may have seen them earlier on some forums)\n\nYes, I think Dendro Archon and Kusanali are two different people, after studied all the known information about Sumeru, as well as the possible country on which the fourth region is based\n\n# First, let's start with what we generally know about Sumeru.\n\n* Sumeru is most likely inspired by the culture of the Middle East (mainly First Persian Empire) and India.\n* It is renowned as the center of learning and houses the Sumeru Academia.\n* Sumeru's landscape features both deserts and forests.\n* It looks like Sumeru has problems with fertile land. I guess this is due to the death of the past Dendro Archon. As you know, the death of gods inflicts tremendous damage by nature. The formation of deserts in the Sumeru area is possible and there are consequences\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21l4q570pfr71.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=e012b7b3c08bbfe4a9680339df033fa9f5cd51e8\n\n# Kusanali is not Dendro Archon\n\n* **LESSER Lord Kusanali.** It's strange to call the most powerful Dendro user, god and ruler - \"Lesser Lord\", and at the same time call some other person \u2013 \"Renowned Lord\" Sangemah Bay (From Aloy's Trailer description). I am the only one who considers it somehow humiliating and diminutive? even if Kusanali is a child (who is 500 years old). Especially when you consider that Dendro Archon is the God of Wisdom. While wisdom and knowledge in Sumeru are fanatically idolized and dubbed as the most important benefit.\n* **Slime theory and Dendro Gem description.** In short, Anemo slimes fly in like Anemo Archon, Geo slimes create shields like Geo Archon, and Electro slimes come in >!two type like Ei and Makoto!<, who are Electro Archons. Based on this, one can assume that Dendro Archon is hiding somewhere while Kusanali is acting as a **mascot**.\n\nLesser Lord Kusanali is translated into \"\u5c0f\u5409\u7965\u8349\u738b\", which roughly translates into lucky star/**mascot** Dendro King. The Sabzeruz Festival celebrate to commemorate the birth of Lesser Lord Kusanali. In CN, Sabzeruz Festival is translated into \u82b1\u795e\u8bde\u65e5 (\u82b1\u795e - Flower God, \u8bde\u65e5 - Day of Birth). Kusanali is addressed as the god of flowers, although Dendro Archon is the god of grass.\n\nUnder the heading for chapter Sumeru there is another title in Latin, which translates as Under the flowers (lie) the light of truth (or wisdom). This can be interpreted as a flower - it is false God - Kusanali (Flower God) and true God - God of Wisdom.\n\n(datamine spoiler) >!Nagadus Emerald Gemstone: \"In the end, life opened its closed fist... granting freedom to all. Men and animals have the ability to express themselves but the plants do not. Therefore, they need a spokesperson.\" The last phrase suggests that Dendro Archon has an assistant who performs the duties of communication with people and nature.!<\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c06lzk24pfr71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=750eb0450375dbc60f078d877de478b879aef48e\n\n* **The gender of Dendro Archon remained unknown**. In the Chinese version, Ganyu's line about Dendro Archon remained gender neutral. Then why line pronounce changed to female? Let's take another look at the description of the change.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkpi6spbpfr71.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d86ec81c5e590736254d07b54482014022dba7\n\n**Description does not say anything about Dendro Archon** and it is entirely **possible that Ganyu's phrase about the Dendro Archon was changed by accident**. Since the localizers thought that Dendro Archon and Kusanali are the same person. Translators don't know more about lore than we do, and they've made mistakes repeatedly (especially in gender pronouns). And all other languages \u200b\u200bpull the same mistakes that remain in the English version\n\nLet's turn to the description of the Archons in Teyvat's Teaser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sq0f56pepfr71.png?width=2401&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10af48040c17c3e18556856b70f598f9ccd0600\n\n* **Ganyu doesn't know more about other Archons than ordinary people**. Even if Ganyu speaks of Kusanali as the Dendro Archon in full, perhaps she is mistaken, because she does not know other more significant deities in Sumeru. If you pay attention to the line above, she speaks of Electro Archon as Raiden Shogun. But after completing the last Archon Quest, we learn that>! Raiden Shogun is not Electro Archon, but a puppet made by the current Electro Archon - Ei. Shogun Raiden never owned gnosis, Ei gave the gnosis to Yae Miko, after Raiden's creation.!<\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbt4rrgpfr71.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8f832c35ffc520c3a13755d5814e4051a5bfd3\n\n# Zoroastrianism reference\n\nZoroastrianism exalts an uncreated and benevolent deity of wisdom, as its supreme being.\n\n* NPCs Anisa mentions that she is training to be a Dastur. A dastur is a high priest(ess) in Zoroastrianism.\n* also Zoroastrianism was predominantly located on the territory of the Persian Empire from which Sumeru was written off\n* Deevs are mentioned in the manga. In English, the word appears as *daeva, div, deev*. A daeva is a Zoroastrian supernatural entity with disagreeable characteristics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o6aekshipfr71.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d6f6eb4ea2ab9f3eedc64845e5f148c5541bfd8\n\n**Ahura Mazda**\\- Lord of Wisdom is the creator deity and highest deity of Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda is the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the Yasna. The literal meaning of the word Ahura is \"lord,\" and that of Mazda is \"wisdom.\" Ahura Mazda was invoked in a triad, with Mithra and Anahita\n\n**Anahita** \u2013 goddess associated with fertility, healing and wisdom. Anahita was a very popular deity, and was also part of the triad of gods immediately after Ahura Mazda.\n\n[Ahura Mazda and Anahita](https://preview.redd.it/2qzrxmc2rfr71.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=728d240e11caf250c5b8d990744d4c5a6dedda91)\n\nBack to Vahid's words - **Anahitian Blessing** is the grace of **Lesser Lord Kusanali**. Therefore, it can be said that in Zoroastrianism, Kusanali is Anahita, and Dendro Archon is Ahura Mazda.\n\n*Why I think that Kusanali cannot be both Anahita and Ahura Mazda?*\n\nFor example, >!Baalzebub(Ei) may be the equivalent of Baal(Makoto). And despite the fact that this is practically the same demon, the scriptwriters still divided Baal into two goddesses.!< And Ahura Mazda and Anahita are very different deities, both in status and in appointment.\n\n# Who is Dendro Archon referring to the Honkai Impact?\n\nI think more than one agreed that the likely prototype of Dendro Archon is **Su**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqamfmpkpfr71.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=1791278e9e806d63b75e3ce83f5fc35ec59c1b66\n\nSu was a user of the 6th key, which directly affects cellular regeneration, thanks to which you can even kill a person.  He is very often associated with wisdom, and also more like the character who owns the Dendro element.\n\nThe key is capable of **growing all kinds of flora** and destroying objects / **organics** at the molecular level, as if aging them.\n\nThe bubble universe Su created with the 2nd key have name the **Seed of Sumeru**\n\n  \nSu's name have Hindi origin:\n\n[https:\\/\\/hamariweb.com\\/names\\/hindu\\/hindi\\/boy\\/su-meaning\\_33665](https://preview.redd.it/asunw30hbhs71.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d0d19fa05b12722cae99227d4f74f655702908)\n\n **Lord** **Shiva**, also known as **Mahadeva**, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the Supreme Being in [Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism), one of the major traditions within Hinduism.  The [Ardhanarisvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardhanarisvara) concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half-man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples. \n\n(next information contain Honkai Impact Version 5.1 Spoiler)\n\n>!Su\u2019s Honkai beast form is a peacock based on (1) Mahamayuri lore and was a really special one associated with the (2) 8th Herrscher. !<\n\n(1) Mahamayuri (\"great peacock\") is a bodhisattva and female **Wisdom King** in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. Yes, that the male character refers to the goddess of wisdom. By the way, one of his titles is Lady of the Lake, so mistakes in gender have a place to be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lgdqcuvpfr71.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=f898b5b3ee750e3f6348877bbcc9884ebcea7bd4\n\n(2) 8th Herrscher (Herrscher of Sentience) is able to create Illusions, create non-material spaces and manipulate them. Also The 8th Herrscher of the Previous Era is able to control over dreams, being able to open dreamscapes, and are able to manipulate the brains of humans.\n\nBack to the Teyvat Teaser:\n\n>\u201cThe God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself, and the oasis of knowledge is a **mirage** in the desert of ignorance. In the city of **scholars there is a push for folly**, yet the God of Wisdom makes no argument against it.\u201d\n\n*\u201cscholars there is a push for folly\u201d -* it looks like many sages are mistaken in their beliefs, thereby gradually alienating new generations from the truth\n\n*A mirage* is a type of optical illusion, but illusion is also a false belief. Creating illusions and reprogramming thinking with illusions is one of The 8th Herrscher's abilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ By the way, the fact that Yae does not know who came up with the idea of \u200b\u200busing knowledge as a resource may possibly send us to the existence of a third party \\(well, or, as always, Fatui is to blame for everything\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/77q8xr4jtfr71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c2eff1c57ef19d5472801f9fad41a0cf787df3)\n\nBack to Slime theory, remember that a large dendro slime creates small dendro slimes around it. The most interesting thing is that after a defeat, small dendro slimes do not drop anything. And if you first defeat the big Dendro slime, then all the created Dendro slimes will evaporate with it, as if their existence depends on it. This suggests that small Dendro slimes are a reference to the illusions that Dendro Archon can create.\n\n# So who is Kusanali referring to the Honkai Impact?\n\nMy choice is Durandal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sq3wxuanpfr71.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=472f0b1b8c69a70a128d4b2cc7bf1bafbdd666f1\n\n>Durandal tells him that his life is filled with too many rules, and that they have the right to choose their fate. Su is moved by her words, and he gives her the Seed of Sumeru, which gives her a new battle suit and allows her to control her bubble better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UPD:  The reason why the God of Wisdom is hiding from the world\n\nIf we view Genshin's universe as part of the Honkaivers, we can speculate why the God of Wisdom is unwilling to contact humans. The fact is that **Honkai is a virus that intensifies and spreads as human civilization develops.**\n\n>The God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself\n\nThe God of Wisdom must be a person who knows everything in this world. **The existence of such a person threatens the existence of Teyvat.** Since the transfer of their knowledge promises the strengthening of Honkai (Abyssual curse).\n\nSomething similar has already happened in the Honkai Impact. Project EMBER (purpose: **Teach Current Era people Previous Era knowledge**) led to More dangerous Honkai appeared due to the sudden advancement: including Chiyou, a Judgment Class Honkai Beast.\n\nTherefore, it is quite possible that the God of Wisdom, knowing what could happen, moved away from society, and in his place put a person who knows nothing.\n\nAnd the fact that Sumeru disposes of knowledge as a commodity is another way so that Sumeru does not repeat the fate of Khaenri'ah. This is an artificially created problem that most likely slows down the development of civilization.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI hope no one got a heart attack from my English, because I am not a native speaker and I translated most of the text in a translator.  Much will become known to us closer to the release of the next region. I think that the chapter on Sumeru should reveal a lot of information regarding the main plot, lore and the past of this world. Therefore, as for me, creating a plot with a false God is a very interesting idea and is justified by the fact that if we could easily receive all the knowledge from the God of Wisdom, then why do many scientists exist, if they just need to come to their deity and ask it directly. There must be some kind of challenge to get the information you want.", "Does anyone know what\u2019s this hose for ? It\u2019s located right behind of the rear impact bar !! 2019 Mazda CX5 touring ! ", "Looks like Mazda SUVs don't do so well for rear seat impact tests ", "this pole was originally 100m up the road, just happens to look like its planted there ", "My strangest moment: a timeline jump from when I died The setting: the mid-1990s. On a rural road in S. Mississippi.  \n\nIt was springtime, just a few months before we were to graduate high school and leave everything we ever knew behind. \n\nMy best friend\u2019s dad owned a used car dealership. The previous week, he had gotten a small sporty Mazda convertible. His dad liked to give his new cars a week or so of running around to make sure he wasn't selling any lemons, so he gave us the keys and sent us off to give it a test drive around the rural backroads of the Pine Belt with heartfelt promises from both of us we would be safe and definitely not speed or drive irresponsibly \u2013 a promise we kept to the next intersection before zooming out of sight.\n\nWe had been driving around for about an hour before coming to this one section of two-lane highway that ran through a flood plain for a small muddy-water creek.  The road was on an embankment so it wouldn't flood every time it rained, so there were steep 15-foot high drop-offs on either side of the road. There's no \"pulling over to the side of the road\" if you were to break down on this section of roadway.\n\nThe stretch we were on was straight but had a small hill that crested at about the halfway mark of this half-mile or so of asphalt. We had been enjoying our freedom and broken promises to his dad, and this particular moment was no different.  We quickly ran up to a car that was very likely going the speed limit, but they were driving way too slow for us in that little Mazda. My friend and I looked at each other with a grin. He downshifted and gave it plenty of gas, eager to leave the slower car in our dust. \n\nAs we crested a hill, a blur of metal appeared in our lane, barreling towards us at an alarming speed. We weren\u2019t even 100 feet from the other car coming straight at us! I distinctly remember the driver in that car bracing himself, his eyes wide knowing his options for avoiding a collision were zero to none.  My best friend and I yelled \"OH SHIT\" in unison as I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable collision. \n\nThere\u2019s no way we could have missed that car. I saw the driver\u2019s eyes. He was so close. Impact was inevitable. Except...\n\nThe sickening explosion of metal crunching against metal at high speed never came. \n\nI opened my eyes and looked to my left.  I saw my friend's arm nonchalantly resting on the door, his mouth open as he sang along to the Gin Blossoms \"Follow You Down.\" It was a beautiful day, the roof down, the radio blaring. Not a car in sight. Not even the one we attempted to pass.\n\nI blinked a few times.  Looked again to make sure I was believing what I was seeing.  Not wanting to hear my friend gloat about how awesome of a driver he is, I didn't ask him how he avoided the other car.  He didn't even seem phased about it. \n\nI'm a skeptical man, but that incident was one of two things in my life I simply cannot explain. \n\nIn our 30s, when we happened to find ourselves in the same town one evening, we met up for beers.  Between asking about our careers and family, I brought up the incident again. \"Remember that time your dad gave us the Mazda to drive around?  And how we almost hit that car?\" \n\nHe thought about it for a second, and I saw the blood drain from his face. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember that! What the hell happened?!\u201d  I told him I didn't know, but I had hoped he would have filled in the blanks.  I felt an ice-cold chill race up my spine.\n\nThis past year, he brought his family to my town for a vacation.  They came to my house for dinner, and I wanted to tell our wives this story and have him tell his side of it all.  This time, my friend seemed to have no recollection of it - as if his mind had completely erased of the experience. Even when I reminded him of our previous conversations about it, he looked at me with a blank stare, as if he had never heard the story before.\n\nAnd so, the mystery of that near-accident on the backroads of Mississippi remains unsolved, a strange and inexplicable memory that haunts me to this day.  A mystery that seems to get stranger as the years go on.", "what is this found this in the glove box of my mazda cx5 when i got it almost a year ago. curious as to what it is and if it\u2019s important for my car ", "My thoughts on my Mk8 6MT APR+ W/ Mods I have a 2024 Mk8 Golf R 6MT that I purchased in February this year, it currently has 9.5k miles. It is a fantastic platform, though from the factory it feels a bit tame. Ive done a few things to it that I believe have greatly improved my satisfaction with this vehicle and I thought I\u2019d share my feedback in case some of you are looking into this platform, or are looking to mod your own Mk8.\n\nMy mods in order of installation are:\n\n- Sportshifters custom GT2 shift knob\n- APR intake\n- APR+ stage 1 tune\n- Rally Armor mudflaps\n- H&R rear sway bar\n- 034 rear end links\n- H&R front sway bar\n- APR front end links\n- APR 7mm wheel spacers (all around)\n- APR lowering springs\n- APR intercooler\n- APR pipes and hoses\n\nFirst off, I know many of you already know this but if you have a Mk8 that is still under warranty going the APR+ route for a tune allows you to maintain a warranty on your drivetrain (as long as you use APR drivetrain parts). The tune, while not the most aggressive, gives a large bump in power from 3rd gear and up. Like many have said before, once I got the tune my smiles-per-gallon rose tremendously and I became convinced that this is how it should have been from the factory. According to APR, i should have about 400hp at the crank, which is more than the vast majority of cars on the road, especially for a compact. I am pleased with the results of this tune, but once my warranty is up, i plan to upgrade my downpipe and get a \u201creal\u201d stage 2 tune from a different tuner. APR doesnt have a true stage 2 tune on this platform, plus I\u2019d be interested to explore new options even if it did. \n\nThe first mod I did was getting a real shift knob, which was arguably the mod that had the biggest impact on the driving experience aside from the tune. If you have a manual hear me now, get rid of the hollow plastic turd they give you from the factory, spend $150 on a real, machined, weighted knob. Do it. Youre missing out if you dont. The factory knob is literally the worst knob ive ever had and, quite frankly, shame on VW for shipping these cars with such a BS shifting apparatus.\n\nEven if you dont go the tuning route, i noticed a slight upgrade in throttle response with the aftermarket intake before i got the tune. This is a nice, cheap addition that will improve the sound of your vehicle and give your gas pedal a bit more pep. Theres no excuse for not getting one.\n\nAs for the suspension upgrades, i had a Mazdaspeed3 back in the day with upgraded sway bars and lowering springs. The thing felt great in an old school mechanical way. And for those of you that dont know about mazdaspeed3s, even from the factory they can do burnouts in 2nd gear. It was a riot to drive, especially after i modded the crap out of it and i miss that car probably more than any other car ive had (EvoX, Sti, Brz, Miata ND, Fiesta ST, 350z, Giulia Q4 to name a few). What im trying to do is reclaim that feeling of tight handling with a planted, low ride. I think the swaybars and springs got me close, but the car still feels a but more dignified than my old Mazda did. For those concerned about accidentally turning their brand new Mk8 into a rigid shitbox by overdoing it in the suspension department, fear not: this car is still comfortable enough, and the springs are DCC compliant, so comfort mode is still softer than race mode. By and large, Its still daily driveable, but definitely less prone to body roll, and it looks better too! (Especially with the spacers).\n\nI did the intercooler and pipes and hoses as a precaution to fight heatsoak, and ti prepare the thing for when i go stage 2. I dont notice much of a power bump from this, but i definitely feel better spiritedly driving in the heat.\n\nOverall, if you are planning doing similar mods, you can expect your Mk8\u2019s handling to be more dialed-in with a very slight trade off in comfort. There will be a very welcome increase in power and passing vehicles on the highway will be a breeze. The car will sound better, look better, and shift a whole lot better (seriously, shift knob is mandatory if you have a 6MT), all while under warranty. This is closer to how the car probably should have been at the price point in my opinion.\n\nTLDR; mods make the car a lot better. APR+ keeps you under warranty while significantly boosting power, but isnt the most aggressive tune you can buy.", "The hatchback design is \ud83d\udcaf This car still feels like a day 1 drive to me (I\u2019ve owned it for 9 months now\ud83d\ude02)", "Well my first Mazda totaled before I can even take possession for it.  So I went to this dealer looking at a 6 but the 3 hatchback naturally caught my eye and only a few grand more. I got approved signed all the paperwork got the credit union on board and took about a week legit last Tuesday I took this picture my first new car from the 2000\u2019s. It did have an impact light on so I wanted the dealership to replace the sensors while they took it to a shop to replace the sensor on the way back the vehicle got rear ended airbags deployed. So my first Mazda got totaled before I even had the keys\u2026", "What features should be standard legally (USA) I can think of 2:\n\n**Easy way to reboot infotainment.**\n\nThere have been so many times where a simple reboot would have fixed a CarPlay connection issue or some other weird bug. It's shocking that this function doesn\u2019t exist for a lot of manufacturers. I remember CarPlay on my 2020 Cadillac XT6 would randomly bug out and the only way to fix it would be to power off the car, open and close the driver door, wait 3-5 minutes, and try again. I called my buddy -- a GM infotainment engineer -- to see if there was a better way, and he said \u201cNot really. You can try reaching under the glovebox and pulling out the harness\u201d. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNow, I\u2019m renting a 23 Mazda CX-9 and CarPlay randomly stopped working. I tried doing the \u201chold the Back, Nav, and Mute buttons\u201d which apparently worked on some previous version of the infotainment. However, it seems that Mazda changed it for this model.\n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating. Just give me a way to turn it off and on again. It\u2019s the most basic step in debugging. Also, just make it one button that I have to hold. I don't want to have to do finger gymnastics.\n\n**Automatic Headlights**\n\nI'm pretty sure ambient light sensors are pretty cheap these days. I'd also like to propose that manufacturers use one of the below proposals for automatic headlight systems.\n\n* Warn the user when lights are OFF and the system detects that it's dark (like Hyundai/Kia).\n* Remove OFF option so that it's just Auto, Parking Lights, and Low Beam.\n\n**Edit:** Adding that when wipers are on, low beams should also be turned on (looking at you Mazda).\n\nI'd like to hear what else you guys think should be standard in new cars these days.", "Forza Motorsport Update 13 Release Notes \u2013 October 14, 2024 From : [https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/34017734482579-Forza-Motorsport-Update-13-Release-Notes-October-14-2024](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/34017734482579-Forza-Motorsport-Update-13-Release-Notes-October-14-2024)\n\nForza Motorsport Update 13 celebrates the first anniversary of Forza Motorsport with 3 all-new Mustang cars completely free to players, as well as a surprise for Car Pass holders.\n\nGet ready to go sideways in your favorite Pony cars with Drift Mode and test your top speeds and high-speed cornering skills on an iconic, fan favorite oval track as Sunset Peninsula makes its long-awaited return to Motorsport.\n\nPlus, new options for Practice and Qualifying are now available for your Private Multiplayer races \u2013 a top community request since launch.\u00a0\n\nThis is Mustang Month in Forza Motorsport, and across the next four weeks, you will get to dive into the rich history, variety and uniqueness that the Ford Mustang has brought to the worlds of motorsport and automotive culture.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Game Content, Features and Events \\[All Platforms\\]**\n\n**New Mode: Drift**\n\nGet sideways! Drift is now a Game Type option in Free Play and Private Multiplayer.\n\n* This includes a new Best Drift scoring option for the highest single continuous drift score (even across multiple laps) in addition to Best Lap and Total Score. Any segment of any track can be drifted for a score. Keep it going: Crossing the finish line will automatically bank your lap score and restart scoring for a new lap. Players earn Drift Score based on speed, angle, and duration of each drift, and this must be successfully \"banked\" to count.\n* A new Drift Zone tab has been added to Rivals, where you can compete for the highest Drift lap score leaderboards in several new events featuring great car and track pairings. Feel free to upgrade and tune for the best drift setup but rear wheel drive only for these events.\n* Drift scoring has also been added to Meetup Game Type options for private Drift Meetups. We are planning to add public Drift Meetups in a future update.\n* The Gameplay & HUD Settings menu includes an option to turn on Drift scoring HUD in other modes, however it will remain off in Featured Multiplayer races. The Drift Camera setting now applies to in-car and follow cameras when enabled.\n\n**Drifting Game Tips**\n\n* Drift Score is based on speed, angle, line, and distance of each drift and must be successfully \u201cbanked\u201d to count. Too much rotation, leaving the track, or collisions can break a Drift Score. To bank a drift, stop drifting without breaking your score.\n* Use rear wheel drive (RWD) cars. Turn off Traction Control (TCS) and Stability Management (STM) and use Manual shifting or Manual w/Clutch. Install the Drift Springs and Dampers upgrade for up to 60 degrees of tunable Steering Angle.\n* There are many ways to start a drift but maintaining it requires a skillful balance of throttle input and countersteer. Here are a few:\n   * Power Over: Enter a turn slower than normal, then power down hard. When the back swings out, begin to countersteer and balance throttle. Best when your car has much more power than grip.\n   * Inertia Drift: Enter a turn faster than normal, then brake hard as you turn. When the back slides out, release the brake and get back on the throttle quickly while countersteering out of the turn.\u00a0\n   * E-Brake Drift: The most well-known method. When you start a turn, release the throttle and tap the e-brake. Wait for the rear to slide, then throttle down and countersteer into the slide.\n   * Clutch Kick: When using Manual with Clutch shifting, as you enter a turn, press the clutch without letting off throttle, then release the clutch. This will break traction and make the rear slide.\u00a0\n   * Scandinavian Flick: As you approach a corner, steer away from the turn, then turn in quickly toward the apex, making the rear slide out as vehicle weight transfers from inside to outside. Braking before turning in can also help by transferring weight back to front.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Practice & Qualifying in Private Multiplayer**\n\nPractice & Qualifying has been added to Private Multiplayer:\n\n* Find this new option in the Event Setup menu under Event Format along with options for Practice time limit, number of Qualifying laps, and Intermission Period.\n* You may choose to be a spectator for the race that follows practice by selecting Spectate Race from the Pre-race or Pause menu at any time during the practice session.\n\n**Forza Race Regulations (FRR) Penalty System**\n\n* Forza Race Regulations now displays the severity of a collision in UI notifications, replacing the \u2018Avoidable contact\u2019 messaging.\n* Individual FRR infractions now have maximum penalty times depending on collision severity, reducing cases where players were over penalized before.\n* Off-Track notifications now display FRR ruling: Small Time Gain, Large Time Gain, or Max Time Gain. Note that the penalty time incurred is a scaling multiplier on time gained, so penalty amounts vary for each. If no time was gained, there is no penalty.\n* Update 13 also includes general accuracy improvements based on the updated data capture system introduced in Update 12.\n\n**Track Addition**\n\n* Sunset Peninsula\n   * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Full Circuit\n   * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Club Circuit\n   * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Oval Circuit\n   * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Full Circuit Reverse\n   * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Club Circuit Reverse\n\nSunset Peninsula\u00a0track layouts are available in Career, Featured Multiplayer Series, Free Play, Private Multiplayer, Featured Rivals and Time Attack.\n\n**Free Musting Cars**\n\nThe following cars have been added to the Showroom for all Forza Motorsport players:\n\n* 2024 Ford #25 Mustang RTR\n* 2024 Ford #88 Mustang RTR\n* 2024 Ford #130 Mustang RTR\n\n**New Car Pass Car**\n\nThe following bonus car will be gifted\u00a0to all Forza Motorsport Car Pass holders starting on Wednesday, October 16 at 4:00 PM PT (Thursday, October 17 at 12:00 AM UTC):\n\n* 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse\n\nThis special, new-to-Motorsport car is available to players who have the Forza Motorsport Car Pass, Deluxe Edition, Premium Edition or Premium Add-Ons Bundle.\n\n**Formula Drift Cars**\n\nThe following cars have been added to the Showroom for all Forza Motorsport players:\n\n* 2020 Formula Drift #151 Toyota GR Supra\n* 2015 Formula Drift #13 Ford Mustang\n* 2006 Formula Drift #43 Dodge Viper SRT10\n* 1997 Formula Drift #777 Nissan 240SX\n\n**Career Events**\n\n* Featured Tour: Mustang Tour (Available from Oct. 16 5pm PT | Oct. 17 12am UTC \u2013 Nov. 27 4pm PT | Nov. 28 12am UTC) \u00a0\u00a0\n   * Last of the Pony Cars (Starts Oct. 16 5pm PT | Oct. 17 12am UTC)\n      * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Full Circuit (5 laps)\n      * Sebring International Raceway \u2013 Full Circuit (3 laps)\n      * Maple Valley \u2013 Full Circuit (5 laps)\n      * Watkins Glen \u2013 Full Circuit (4 laps)\n   * Colt Classics (Starts Oct. 23 5pm PT | Oct. 24 12am UTC)\n      * Eaglerock Speedway \u2013 Club Circuit (11 laps)\n      * Lime Rock Park \u2013 South Chicane Circuit (7 laps)\n      * Laguna Seca \u2013 Short Circuit (6 laps)\n      * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Club Circuit (6 laps)\n   * Street Stallions (Starts Oct. 30 5pm PT | Oct. 31 12am UTC)\n      * Sebring International Raceway \u2013 Short Circuit (6 laps)\n      * Road America \u2013 East Circuit (6 laps)\n      * Grand Oak \u2013 National Circuit Reverse (5 laps)\n      * Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course \u2013 Short Circuit (6 laps)\n   * Wild Horses (Starts Nov. 6 5pm PT | Nov. 7 12am UTC)\n      * Daytona \u2013 Sports Car Circuit (4 laps)\n      * Laguna Seca \u2013 Full Circuit (5 laps)\n      * Indianapolis \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit (5 laps)\n      * Viriginia International Raceway \u2013 Grand West Circuit (3 laps)\n   * Reward Showcase (Complete all Mustang Tour series)\n      * Sunset Peninsula \u2013 Full Circuit (5 laps)\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Open Class Tour (Available from Oct. 16 5pm PT | Oct. 17 12am UTC \u2013 Nov. 6 4pm PT / Nov. 7 12am UTC)\n   * D Class Series\n      * Catalunya \u2013 National Alt Circuit\n      * Grand Oak \u2013 Club Circuit\n      * Maple Valley \u2013 Short Circuit\n   * C Class Series\n      * Sebring International Raceway \u2013 Short Circuit\n      * Laguna Seca \u2013 Short Circuit\n      * Eaglerock Speedway \u2013 Club Circuit Reverse\n   * B Class Series\n      * Homestead-Miami Speedway \u2013 Road Circuit\n      * Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course \u2013 Short Circuit\n      * Road America \u2013 East Circuit\n   * A Class Series\n      * Watkins Glen \u2013 Full Circuit\n      * Hakone \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit\n      * Brands Hatch \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit\n   * S Class Series\n      * Sebring International Raceway \u2013 Full Circuit\n      * Kyalami \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit\n      * Hockenheim \u2013 Full Circuit\n   * R Class Series\n      * Silverstone \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit\n      * Homestead-Miami Speedway \u2013 Road Circuit\n      * Indianapolis \u2013 Grand Prix Circuit\n   * Reward Showcase (Complete all Open Tour series)\n      * Sunset Peninsula -

Since my last post caused a bit of confusion I want to explain why I tested my new 5800X3D with a game running at 720p.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbs8otb04kia1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e712e088e28944ef304e8b57bc92f5035fb9652\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nYou find yourself at a car dealer, standing in front of a neat Mazda and a sleek Porsche.\n\nBoth cars look quite nice and you ask yourself: Which one's faster?\n\nSo you take both cars onto the highway and closely watch the speedometer.\n\nAs a law-abiding citizen you can't drive faster than 130km/h.\n\nBoth cars, the Mazda and the Porsche cap out at exactly 130km/h.\n\nQED: Both cars, the Mazda and the Porsche offer the exact same top-speed.\n\nBut wait! No one in their right mind would test a high-end car on the highway with a speed limit, right?\n\nExactly, we would rather do that on the race-way where no speed-limit is imposed on us.\n\nOk, looks like we found common ground.\n\nBut, now we want to test two CPUs.\n\nSince we came to understand that speed-limits are bad for comparing race-cars, it should be understandable, that we also don't want to compare the CPUs with an imposed speed-limit, right?\n\nCool. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Before we start:**\n\nAt first there are some key points that need to be understood for clearing up the concept of the CPU tests.\n\nThe CPU is the brain of the computer, it tells all the other hardware what it's supposed to do.\n\nIf you play a game, the CPU is responsible for the game logic and for telling the GPU what to draw on the screen.\n\nThe CPU makes a so called \"Drawcall\" towards the GPU, waits until the GPU has finished its task, then makes the next drawcall. And so on, and so forth.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n* The CPU wants the GPU to draw a white cube onto a black background.\n* The CPU is powerfull and fast enough to generate 144 of those drawcalls per second.\n* The CPU does not care how good or bad the endresult is, it only cares if the task got finished.\n* The GPU recieves this drawcall and does its best to fullfill the task.\n* The GPU is powerfull and fast enough to draw the requested image:\n   * 240x per second in 720p\n   * 120x per second in 1080p\n   * 60x per second in 1440p\n   * 30x per second in 2160p\n* Depending on which resolution the GPU is forced to work with, the GPU takes less or more time before it finishes the picture.\n* It is the User who forces the GPU to make nice or bad images.\n* The GPU just does what it was told to do and no matter how much time that takes.\n* The CPU still couldn't care less if the GPU was fast and made a crude 720p image or took its time with a nice 2160p rendering.\n\nIf you watch your FPS-counter in a game you will see a number.\n\nLet's imagine that the counter shows you a solid 69FPS. Nice.\n\nWhat you're watching is the number of frames your GPU is painting on your monitor per second - on average.\n\nIf your CPU was capable to pull off 144 Drawcalls for that game, but you force your GPU to make high-quality frames, so the GPU only manages to push out 69 (still nice) FPS, that counter will show you 69FPS.\n\nThe counter does not care about what could be, it only is interested in the cold, harsh truth.\n\nLet's summarize:\n\n* The CPU could ask the GPU for 144 FPS - That's pretty much set in stone.\n* The GPU can provide a range of FPS, depending on user-preference.\n* The FPS counter shows the amount of FPS the slower part produces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to do \"CPU-Testing\":**\n\nFirst of all, we need to set a resolution which is low enough, that the GPU can provide more FPS than the CPU we want to test. - Remember the highway and the car? Good.\n\nSince 16:9 is the most common formfactor for monitors we choose the lowest 16:9 resolution and end up with 1280x720 pixels, or 720p short (or \"HD\", even shorter).\n\nThen we need to take care of the graphic settings of the game.\n\nSome graphic settings only put strain on the GPU.\n\nOther graphic settings can also put additional load on the CPU.\n\nFor testing the CPU it is important to choose the settings in a way that maximizes the strain on the CPU and takes of as much GPU-load as possible.\n\nIf possible, just run [720p@max.Settings](mailto:720p@max.Settings) but keep in mind that there still is the risk of running into a GPU limit. Yes, I'm serious.\n\nAfter all that is sorted, we can benchmark our game with different CPUs and happily take note of the different performance numbers. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Silly numbers are silly:**\n\nSome common questions and/or suggestions regarding 720p CPU tests:\n\n* No one plays in 720p.\n* No one plays in 1080p.\n* Who cares how fast a CPU is in low resolution scenarios?\n* How fast is the CPU at \"insert desired resolution\"?\n* I want real-world performance data.\n* You're stupid!\n* What tool(s) did you use?\n\nMy answers:\n\n* The goal is to provide a setting in which CPUs can be compared to each other without running into a GPU bottleneck.\n* Take a look at the latest steam-survey and brace yourself for a surprise.\n* Ok, I'll answer this one later on...\n* The CPU always offers the same performance, regardless of the chosen resolution\n* Wait a sec., I'll come to that soon.\n* But not much.\n* Mainly CapFrameX, really awesome Software, check it out. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, we now know that a CPU is capable of providing insanely high FPS once the GPU limit is taken out of the equation.\n\nWhat the hell are we now supposed to do with that information?\n\nIt depends.\n\nIf you're one of the lucky ones who can afford to always buy the latest, top-notch hardware you probably don't need to care much. You're just going to buy the fastest CPU anyway, so the Benchmarks won't tell you anything new overall.\n\nIf you have to buy a CPU with the afterthought that it stays relevant as long as possible, you're probably someone who will read through CPU-tests with great interest.\n\nLet me show you why:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wx283734kia1.png?width=3469&format=png&auto=webp&s=d597026b1a95d86deec10c4bbac968d2f9ac2908\n\nWhat you're seeing here is a compilation of two tests in a single chart.There are the results of a GPU-Test and the results of a CPU-Test.The dots on the line represent the FPS with each card the CPU got paired with.\n\nDepending on the GPU used, almost all CPUs seem to offer the same performance.\n\n*When I created those charts, the 3080Ti did not exist / was only rumored about.So you only had the 2080Ti at your exposal for testing.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7kd76244kia1.png?width=3469&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6c1517a2e85c2e9ebc938444f522db16024d21\n\nNow again, but with the CPU-Test at 720p resolution.Here we can clearly see the potential performance of each CPU.\n\nWe also can use this chart to make a good decision about which CPU and GPU make a good pair.\n\nAnd the best thing, we can predict if a GPU upgrade in future will net a performance boost.\n\nThe only thing we had to do was to take the GPU out of the equation by testing in a low resolution. :)\n\nAwesome, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nIf you're playing games exclusively in UHD/max.Settings you may are tempted to ignore the impact of the CPU performance since pretty much every potato-chip manages to pull of 60FPS.\n\nBut keep in mind that average FPS numbers are a sub-optimal metric for depicting the \"experience\" of the game.\n\nIf your CPU is too slow it can lead to hitching, stuttering gameplay. That doesn't show in the average FPS since those microstutters are too short to impact the average value. But you'll notice them.\n\nThat's where Min. FPS and Percentile FPS come to play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nzg53p54kia1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=0439baa3e834ee56445f07f8321d2a235e2acdf9\n\nYou all most likely know this type of graph.\n\nMost prominently it shows the average FPS value each CPU is capable of providing for the game.\n\nBut also the so called Percentiles.\n\nSome people call the 1% Percentile the Minimum FPS but that is not correct.\n\nMinimum FPS are the absolute lowest recorded value during the Benchmark.\n\n1% Percentile FPS are the lowest 1% of all recorded FPS during the Benchmark.\n\nNo matter how big, bad and expensive your build was, your games will stutter.\n\nThe stuttering will be so short and far between that you don't notice it, but the Benchmark records nonetheless.\n\nSo if your game runs with 1FPS for 1 milisecond you will not notice that.\n\nBut your minimum FPS will show you 1FPS which is not a useful information.\n\nThats why you rule out those \"errors\" by averaging the lowest 1% of all FPS with the 1% Percentile Metric.\n\nIf your P1 FPS are good it basically tells you that your game will not show noticeable stuttering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07zkczu64kia1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=1314d4ff31c1029012a432b031daecbeaf56c347\n\nHere's the same data-set, but drawn as a Frame-Variance over time.\n\nYou can clearly see that the FPS are fluctuating between 0-400.\n\nEvery CPU will show this kind of behaviour.\n\nBut the faster and better the CPU, the less likely it is to fall below a certain threshold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nIf your CPU test shows you 300FPS in 720p that means, that you can most likely expect good frametimes, even when you limit your FPS via high GPU settings.\n\nSide Note:\n\nThese Frame-Variances also show up when you test with higher resolutions, but then you wouldn't be able to compare one CPU to another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CPU Performance Resolution Scaling:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1sd4zs31ria1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2b403400dfe74aa102d8503638aca79647bc52\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqj2cf251ria1.png?width=1733&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ad7c413f0d214e9e2d672ce71072e302b1b803\n\nThat's it.  \nI hope that I managed to clear this topic up a little.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award. \ud83d\ude0a", "Extremely Depressing I\u2019ve had my Mazda for a month now, someone hit and ran my car at 6:30 in the morning \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m beyond depressed.

Moin, nachdem mein 2012er BMW F20 116i nun in ein Alter gekommen ist, in dem er anf\u00e4ngt Kapriolen zu machen und mich mehr Geld kostet als mir f\u00fcr ein Alltagsauto lieb ist, wird es wohl Zeit f\u00fcr etwas neues.   \n  \nDas Problem: Ich liebe alles, was mir der Einser bietet, vom Fahrgef\u00fchl \u00fcber das Schaltgetriebe bis zum Aussehen, und der neue w\u00e4re nur eine Vernunftentscheidung. Um den emotionalen Impact etwas abzufedern w\u00fcrde ich ungern ein allzu gro\u00dfes Downgrade in Kauf nehmen. Dennoch, Vernunft muss sein, also muss ein Kleinwagen her (Auch kleine SUVs schlie\u00dfe ich aus Prinzip aus - b\u00e4h!). \n\nEckdaten die ich mir w\u00fcnschen w\u00fcrde: Ein Schaltgetriebe (Sechsgang ideal), >100PS und ein sparsamer, zuverl\u00e4ssiger Benziner. Mehr brauche ich nicht - Infotainment, NVH, Komfort, Ausstattung generell sind vollkommen egal. Sch\u00f6n w\u00e4re, wenn das Auto sich beim fahren solide anf\u00fchlt. Der i10 meiner Freundin f\u00fchlt sich in allen belangen (besonders beim Schalten) an wie ein Spielzeug, was mich st\u00f6rt.  \nWenn ich ein ansonsten unkomfortables Auto ohne Infotainment neu kaufen k\u00f6nnte w\u00fcrde ich's machen, da bin ich komplett anspruchslos.\n\nIn frage kommen mmN. Leasing oder Finanzierung, da ich ungern meine finanziellen Reserven auf einen Schlag in einen Neuwagen ballern w\u00fcrde, der mich nicht begeistert. Eine Garantie und evtl. eine Mobilit\u00e4tsgarantie w\u00e4ren wichtig. Monatliche Zahlung sollte sich unter 300\u20ac halten, bei einer Sonder-/Anzahlung die in etwa dem Wert meines Einsers entspricht, also vermutlich ca, 4k.\n\nBis jetzt in der Auswahl:\n\n\\-VW Polo 1.0TSI Schalter (hatte demletzt beruflich einen als Leihwagen, zwar als Automatik, aber der fuhr schon mal ganz solide, hat als Schalter aber leider nur 95PS)\n\n\\-Audi A1 Sportback, sehr sch\u00f6n, leider etwas teuer\n\n\\-Hyundai i10 (N-Line?) Preislich attraktiv, habe nur etwas Angst vor der Qualit\u00e4t: Der i10 meiner Freundin hat bei 100tkm \u00d6l in seine Brennr\u00e4ume gekotzt, und f\u00fchlt sich an wie ein Haufen Plastik\n\n\\-Skoda Fabia (Ich gehe mal davon aus das der dem Polo sehr \u00e4hnelt, da VAG)\n\n\\-Suzuki Swift Sport\n\n\\-Renault Clio, mit dem 0,9l Turbo   Ich hatte mal einen Clio IV, der hatte zwar mit dem 72PS-Sauger den scheu\u00dflichsten Motor aller Zeiten, aber das Chassis war eigentlich nicht schlecht...\n\n  \nWas sind euere Meinungen/Erfahrungen zu den Vorschl\u00e4gen? Was f\u00e4llt euch sonst noch so ein?  \nUnd wie ist euer Take zum momentanen Neuwagen/Leasingmarkt?  \nIch bin \u00fcber jede Diskussion/Anregung dankbar...\n\n", "Just hit 102K miles Needed an oil change and took it in to the quick lube service at Mazda and they told me they noticed I had some oil leaking and should get it checked out with their service department.

disconnecting a wheel and reconnecting with a controller in Featured Multiplayer. \\[1728706\\]\n\n**Gameplay**\u00a0**\\[All Platforms\\]**\n\n* Introduced a Tire Wear Scale option to Free Play and Private Multiplayer, allowing adjustments to the rate at which tires are worn. 1x is the default value. At 2x, tire wear will occur twice as fast. Values range from .5x to 10x.

Furthermore, the Yaris takes up vastly less space, does less damage to the roads, and does vastly less damage to other vehicles in an accident.\n\nThe goal of tax breaks for certain vehicles shouldn't be to specifically reward one kind of propulsion over the other; it should be to encourage choices which are better for society as a whole (as opposed to the individual wants and needs of the purchaser).

To celebrate, we\u2019ve made global changes in both Updates 13 and 14 to improve the racing experience across the game, and to make oval racing especially shine:\n\n* Tuned Drivatar AI on Ovals to have cleaner race starts, transition more smoothly after race start, and to trail more effectively.\n* Tuned car-to-car collision response for more physically accurate energy dissipation. This reduces the impact of small collisions and allows for more stability and control.\n* Downforce reduction for lead cars when drafting was reduced to make it easier to maintain position. (Update 13)\n* Improved Drivatar AI trailing ability especially in braking zones, making Drivatars less prone to rear ending other cars. (Update 13)\n* Updated the multi-car aero model to reduce downforce impact on leading cars, widen the aero wake near the car, smooth transitions near wake edges and reduce drafting induced aero balance changes. (Update 13)\n* Additionally, we\u2019ve added support for rolling starts in Featured Multiplayer. Rolling starts will be enabled for all events in the NASCAR Series in Featured Multiplayer in Update 14. Rolling starts will be added to additional events, where appropriate, starting in Update 15.\n\nThis update also refreshes Homestead-Miami Speedway track layouts with new NASCAR branding.\n\n**Forza Race Regulations**\n\nWith Update 14, we\u2019ve pushed a new Forza Race Regulations model with a slight reduction to false positive penalty assignments, and an improvement to severity assignment.\n\n**Advanced Ghosting in Multiplayer**\n\nAdvanced Ghosting is a support mechanism for Multiplayer and Forza Race Regulations to help prevent some key collision or off-track situations from adversely affecting the online racing experience. Players will be ghosted in the following scenarios:\n\n* Predicted high relative velocity collisions: when an imminent collision between two cars is detected while driving above the speed threshold, the car with the higher velocity will be ghosted. This does not include low-relative velocity collisions like small fender bumps.\n* Returning to track: when a car goes off track, they will be ghosted to prevent collisions caused by unsafe re-entry until they have returned to track and reached a minimum speed threshold.\n* Stopped on track or driving below a speed threshold: cars that are driving too slowly or are entirely stopped and blocking traffic will be ghosted to prevent risk to other cars.\n* Driving the wrong way on track: cars driving the wrong direction on track will be ghosted until they are driving in the correct direction and meeting a minimum speed threshold. This is an existing behavior but has been expanded to include cars at extreme angles relative to track direction and speed.\u00a0\n\nExperientially, our goal was to use this system to safeguard against egregious collision and\u00a0griefing behavior, while preserving the physical authenticity of racing where bumping and touching may occur when fighting for position.\n\n**Career Events**\n\n*

With Speedsource seeming to no longer exist (website and Twitter both gone) after the Mazda prototype program moved to Joest, I'm left wondering what the ST class in CTSCC will look like. TCR is coming in next year, slotting in below the GT4 cars, and Speedsource's closing would take some of the Miatas off the ST grid, leaving only the Caymans and Minis, assuming the Minis don't go to TCR. Will IMSA want to continue a single-car class in Conti?\n\nDisclaimer: I know nothing for sure.", "budget is 6k should i jump on this? ", "Mazda Roadpacer AP: General Motors' only production rotary-engined production car The failed ambition of a large car (Holden Premier from Australia) and small rotary (1.3L 13B) was only produced from 1975-1977, but it deserves a place and inspection at r/WeirdWheels.\n\nLike many large cars, its development prior to the Oil Crisis and introduction in the mid-1970s, with increased anti-pollution controls, made it a tough sell.\n\nGeneral Motors Holden produced the HX Premier and exported it to Mazda, which fitted a 13B rotary and a Mazda three speed automatic transmission.\n\nThis car attracted an extra wide car tax (to discourage large foreign imports) and was positioned at the top of the Mazda range, competing with Toyota and Nissan large limo-style sedans.\n\nSome have returned to Australia as enthusiast vehicles, but there's a Japanese enthusiast with a fleet of four!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/debopacer\n\n> Announced on April 1 \u2013 the symbolism might have escaped the maker \u2013 the Roadpacer was essentially an imported Premier with a Mazda 13B Wankel engine.\n\n> Annual reports had the Roadpacer \"standing on top of the Mazda line-up of passenger cars\" but it was a sales disaster. Various factors were at play, among them the lingering effect of the energy shock and the Wankel engine's thirst \u2013 it drank like a salaryman at the end of a long week.\n\n> Despite the promise of greater fuel economy from the 13B Wankel (the 'AP' in the Mazda Roadpacer AP nameplate stood for 'Anti Pollution'), contemporary reports suggested Mazda's big and bloated executive sedan consumed petrol at the rate of 9mpg or, in today's parlance, 26L per 100km. Ooof!\n\nhttps://www.drive.com.au/caradvice/mazda-roadpacer-ap-what-a-wankel-of-a-car-drive-flashback/\n\n> It was the first large Japanese car to meet the 1975 emissions standards, although that was a short-lived distinction because the Nissan President followed suit a month later. In October 1975, the engine was revised to meet the 1976 emissions standards, at which time the car gained the \"AP\" (Anti-Pollution) moniker. \n\n> The Roadpacer has the distinction of being the only General Motors product ever fitted for production with a rotary engine.\n\n> The engine produced 135 PS (99 kW; 133 hp) but just 186 N\u22c5m (137 lb\u22c5ft) of torque, at a peaky 4,000 rpm, meaning the Roadpacer performed rather poorly as it weighed 1,575 kg (3,472 lb).[3] The Roadpacer was introduced to compete with large Japanese flagship sedans Toyota Century, Nissan President, Isuzu Statesman de Ville, and the Mitsubishi Debonair. \n\n> Negotiations began in April 1973; the collaboration with Holden was agreed to shortly before Mazda entered into an engineering partnership with Ford. This materialized before the Roadpacer was able to go on sale but did not impact the car's introduction.\n\n> The 13B produced less power than the Red series motors that powered the equivalent Holdens, and significantly less torque, meaning performance was restrained with a 165 km/h (103 mph) top speed, poor acceleration and terrible fuel consumption from the overworked engine.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_Roadpacer", "Large Dealership sold me a car without my permission. Now I'm suspended. Hello all, I am here to get advice to a small development to my post\u00a0[here in ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1e50c34/fl_large_dealership_sold_me_a_vehicle_without_my/)\u00a0But now I can't post this update or question there anymore.\n\nBasically the dealer had made a mistake and didn't void a sale even though I never signed or paid for anything. They sold me the car without my knowing and my license got suspended. I had been continuously asking the dealer for documents so I can make a police report and file a complaint with the dmv. In short the dealer is wanting to reimburse me for any out of pocket expenses for my inconvenience instead. I told him it would be hard to express a dollar value for getting my license suspended. Every time I get insurance from now on I will have to disclose that my license got suspended and anywhere else from now on. I'm not sure how this will impact me but it is the preferred path for the dealer as it beats getting a criminal record for id fraud and possibly losing their dealers license from the dmv.\n\nAfter mentioning that in email, the dealer still says to forward any costs associated with the debacle to his accountant and I will be reimbursed immediately. Knowing of course that we haven't agreed on a number because it was nebulous and I mentioned that technically there was no civil damages just my license suspended due to their mistake. I no official invoice to send her.\n\nWell folks, what's your advice? Should I take this deal, is this legal? It brings me no joy to give someone a record over an honest mistake. I'm thinking I should take it in lieu of the reports. How much should I realistically ask for and what should I send?", "No buyer\u2019s remorse (but price stung) Loved the salesman experience and he seemed to hook me up. But after seeing all the extra costs my heart sunk. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is normal or if I way over paid.

Stanley Eitzen & Maxine Baca Zinn & Kelly Eitzen Smith", "I 100% get why Harris and Biden need to take the anti-Nippon steel position, but I think the deal is smart. **TL;DR:** Japanese car companies like Toyota and Honda transformed the US auto industry in the late 20th century by introducing efficient processes, improving quality, and benefiting workers through better conditions and job stability. A similar boost could happen if Nippon Steel acquires a US Steel. They bring advanced technology and expertise that would modernize US plants, improve worker safety, and make the industry more competitive. The deal would also enhance US-Japan ties, strengthening both countries' national security in a time of rising tensions in the Pacific.\n\nHear me out: \n\nJapanese car companies\u2019 acquisitions and partnerships with US automakers in the late 20th century transformed the US automotive landscape, both for workers and the industry itself. Companies like Toyota and Honda brought with them efficient manufacturing processes, such as lean production and the Toyota Production System, which were integrated into American plants. These methods resulted in higher productivity, improved product quality, and a more engaged workforce.\n\nFor US workers, these Japanese-led partnerships introduced new ways of working. American employees found themselves part of more collaborative, team-based environments, with a focus on continuous improvement (Kaizen). This increased job satisfaction and often provided new skill sets as workers took on more responsibility and autonomy within the production process. There was initial union anxiety, but these changes largely benefited the workforce in terms of job stability and working conditions.\n\n[Edit: One notable example is the collaboration between Toyota and GM in the 1980s at the CA NUMMI plant. After the introduction of lean manufacturing and the Kaizen approach, productivity increased significantly, as the NUMMI plant became more efficient. Quality improved with defect rates dropping to levels comparable with Toyota\u2019s Japanese plants. Worker morale also rose because employees were empowered to contribute to improving the production process.]\n\nMoreover, the transfer of knowledge and techniques from Japanese companies helped revitalize US manufacturing. The quality of US-produced vehicles improved, as American companies adopted more efficient production techniques, helping them better compete globally. These partnerships led to long-term gains for the US car industry, pushing it toward higher quality and more innovative practices. People moving companies distributed that expertise.\n\nSo, a similar scenario could unfold if Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel were to acquire US Steel. Nippon Steel, with its advanced technology and expertise in high-quality steel production, would likely improve US operations, just as Japanese automakers did. US steelworkers would benefit from updated processes, (probably) safer working conditions, and new technologies that enhance efficiency and product quality. Over time, these improvements could strengthen the US steel industry\u2019s global competitiveness.\n\nTo be fair to the alternatives, if a Nippon Steel deal falls through, alternative strategies could still provide benefits to the US steel industry, but they may not be as immediately impactful, and some of them need not be mutually exclusive:\n\n* Domestic consolidation and restructuring could streamline operations but might lead to job losses in the short term. By consolidating, companies could streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and cut costs, making them more resilient in a global market where competition, particularly from countries like China, is fierce.\n\nHowever, this process often comes with short-term pain, particularly for workers. If your goal is to avoid job loss, this ain\u2019t it.\n\nWhen companies merge or restructure, there is usually an effort to eliminate overlap, which often results in plant closures, layoffs, or the elimination of certain roles. Administrative and management functions, as well as older, less efficient production lines, tend to be the first to go. This could mean significant job losses in areas where steel production has long been a cornerstone of the local economy, contributing to economic distress in steel towns that are already struggling.\n\nWhile consolidation could lead to a more efficient and stronger steel industry overall, the immediate impact on jobs might be severe, especially in communities where employment alternatives are limited. Over time, as these consolidated companies become more competitive, they could create new jobs, but the short-term reality for many workers would involve layoffs, the need for retraining, or relocation.\n\n* Strategic partnerships with other foreign steelmakers could bring similar technological improvements, but the scale and expertise Nippon Steel offers might be unmatched. South Korea and India are also strong US allies with similar benefits, but Japan\u2019s established defense and economic ties make Nippon Steel a more seamless fit for strategic purposes. India is experiencing democratic backslide. European companies like ArcelorMittal could be a safe option but might not bring the same geopolitical benefits as deepening ties with a Pacific ally like Japan. China is essentially a non-starter due to the high security risks.\n\n* Government intervention through tariffs or subsidies could protect domestic jobs, but it risks being a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution. It\u2019s also, basically, a bailout, depending on scope and kind. While government intervention could stabilize the industry temporarily, it\u2019s more of a stop-gap measure rather than a sustainable long-term solution. Partnering with a foreign company like Nippon Steel brings immediate innovation and investment that a bailout might not provide.\n\nAnyway, on net? I think the odds are in favor of Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition offering immediate capital investment, advanced technology transfer, and global expertise, making it the most direct way to revitalize the US steel industry in the near term.\n\nFinally, national security. A Nippon Steel acquisition carries strategic advantages for both the US and Japan, particularly in the context of growing tensions in the Pacific region. As China expands its influence, collaboration between the U.S. and Japan on critical industries like steel manufacturing could enhance the resilience of both nations\u2019 supply chains, ensuring that vital materials for defense, infrastructure, and technological development remain secure.\n\nStrengthening the steel industry through Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition would also bolster the US\u2019 ability to produce high-grade steel for military and defense purposes, reducing reliance on adversarial nations for critical materials. For Japan, deepening economic ties with the US reinforces a key strategic alliance in a region facing increasing geopolitical threats.\n\nSorry, I have a bit of a bee in my bonnet about this one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s manifestly the best thing ever, but the US has this knee jerk reaction to any foreign company and hope that this is mostly posturing until the election is over. Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of US Steel would bring both immediate and long-term benefits to the US workforce, mirroring the positive impact seen in the auto industry. US workers would gain from new technologies and safer working conditions, while the US steel industry would benefit from increased efficiency, competitiveness, and product quality. Strategically, this acquisition would fortify the US- Japan alliance, offering critical national security benefits as tensions rise in the Pacific.\n\n(I\u2019m on my phone so apologies for formatting and the fact that my autocorrect makes US/U.S. inconsistent. I was trying to be less exasperated and flippant this post.)", "Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation\u2014A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.\n\nThis report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.\n\n**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples \n\nTesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: \n\n**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla\u2019s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla\u2019s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. \n\n**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA\u2019s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla\u2019s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. \n\n**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla\u2019s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\\~7x) and Toyota (\\~6x). \n\nTech Companies EV/EBITDA: \n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): \\~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. \n* Apple (AAPL): \\~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.\n\nThese valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. \n\n**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla\u2019s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.\n\n**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla\u2019s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. \n\n**Financial Performance Analysis** \n\nRevenue Growth Deceleration Tesla\u2019s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.\n\nTesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. \n\nPolicy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump\u2019s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. \n\nFree Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. \n\nCompetitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla\u2019s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: \n\n* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. \n* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. \n\nVolkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. \n\n**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** \n\nTesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as \"Full Self-Driving,\" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy \n\n* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. \n   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company\u2019s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.\n*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. \n   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. \n\n**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.\n\n* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. \n\n**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla\u2019s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla\u2019s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. \n\nRegulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological\u2014it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla\u2019s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. \n\nCost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla\u2019s **already declining gross margins**. \n\nReliance on Low Costs: Tesla\u2019s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**\u2014both untenable given Tesla\u2019s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla\u2019s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla\u2019s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle\u2014the holy grail of autonomy\u2014highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla\u2019s competitive edge in the autonomy race. \n\n**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla\u2019s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla\u2019s existing commitments. \n\nDevelopment Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. \n\nCompetition: Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. \n\nOptimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: \n\n**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. \n\nLack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla\u2019s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers\u2014producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla\u2019s financial and technical limitations.\n\nLevel 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. \n\nVehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing\u2014placing further pressure on Tesla\u2019s finances. \n\nFinancial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk\u2019s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla\u2019s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.\n\nInvestor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla\u2019s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on Musk\u2019s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company\u2019s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla\u2019s business strategy. \n\nUnlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla\u2019s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla\u2019s brand reputation**. Tesla\u2019s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla\u2019s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla\u2019s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. \n\nTesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology \n\n* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. \n* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. \n* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. \n\nTesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. \n\n**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. \n\nTesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. \n\n**Legal and Regulatory Risks** \n\n* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. \n* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla\u2019s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla\u2019s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: \n* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. \n* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. \n* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla\u2019s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company\u2019s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. \n* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla\u2019s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. \n* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla\u2019s market share. \n* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. \n* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla\u2019s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. \n* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. \n* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla\u2019s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. \n\nTesla\u2019s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus\u2014all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. \n\nAs competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla\u2019s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla\u2019s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors. \n\nDisclaimer: This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

It was founded in 2003 by a group of Silicon Valley engineers. The company was able to successfully overcome entry barriers in the car industry, while pioneering the production of electric cars (Stringham, Miller, and Clark 2015). Today, the vehicles are created in Fremont, California; in addition, more manufacturing facilities are being built in the US and the Netherlands (\u201cAbout Tesla\u201d n.d.).\n\nThe company is also constructing a \u201cgigafactory\u201d at the moment, the aim of which is to produce a large number of lithium-ion cells that could be used to power cars (up to 500,000 vehicles yearly) and other devices (The Economist 2014).\n\nThe company sells its vehicles mainly in the US. It recently went global; the first Tesla car was delivered to Europe in August 2013, whereas the first delivery to Asia was carried out in April 2014 (O\u2019Hara 2015). The organization\u2019s entry to the Asian market, where there are wealthy people who wish to purchase luxury vehicles that would be different from those of their peers, was initially successful.\n\nHowever, the company faces certain complications related, for example, to the \u201crange anxiety\u201d of its customers, that is, the fear that they will not be able to recharge their car if they travel too far (\u201cMusk reboots Tesla\u2019s China strategy\u201d 2015). In Europe, the most successful entry was into Norway, which is known as an environmentally friendly nation, and also, as a matter of fact, where Tesla Motors was supported by the government, becoming the best-selling brand (O\u2019Hara 2015). The enterprise also sells its cars in a number of other European countries. More details about the geography of Tesla\u2019s international operations can be found on the map of the global network of Tesla Motors (see below).\n\n## Motives for Tesla Expanding Internationally\n\n### Fulfilling the Mission of the Company\n\nThere are a number of reasons that prompted the Tesla Motors company to expand into the international market. First, it is worth mentioning that, according to the company\u2019s website, the mission of the business is to manufacture and promote a product that would allow for a more sustainable use of the natural environment (Musk 2013).\n\nEnvironmental concerns are crucial when it comes to the transportation industry; some statistics show that the transportation sector is responsible for almost 70% of global oil consumption, as well as for approximately 57% of emissions of greenhouse gases that cause harm to the environment (Mangram 2012). Because environmental concerns are global, it is paramount to promote the use of electric vehicles all over the world, not only in the US. Therefore, fulfilling its mission is one of the reasons for Tesla Motors to expand internationally.\n\n### Market Access Interests\n\nFurthermore, it should be highlighted that, according to Mangram (2012), the company experienced a large net loss as of the quarter ending in March 2011; the total revenues were listed as $49 million, whereas the net losses amounted to nearly $48.9 million. This means that it was critical for the business to expand into the international market, in order to increase the potential amount of sales and start making more profit.\n\nIn addition, it is of the essence that many governments around the globe pay attention to environmental problems. Environmental awareness provides a stimulus for governments to provide some special advantages to the companies that promote the use of environmentally friendly technologies. As has already been mentioned, Tesla Motors was able to obtain a number of benefits from the government of Norway, which helped the enterprise to become the best-selling brand in that country (O\u2019Hara 2015).\n\nThe government of China also provides Tesla Motors with numerous advantages, which allow the company to more profitably sell its cars in that market, and there is a high probability that China may provide a considerable opportunity for the growth of this enterprise (Trefis Team 2016). Because of governmental policies in some countries, selling vehicles in certain foreign countries allows the corporation to make more profit per car sold in these countries, which makes this sort of expansion more attractive for the business.\n\n### Sourcing Efficiency\n\nIt may be possible to hypothesize that sourcing efficiency has not been the primary goal of the international expansion of Tesla Motors, so far. It was already noted that the company currently produces its vehicles in California, and that additional manufacturing plants are being built in the US, and also in Holland (\u201cAbout Tesla\u201d n.d.). Thus, the company transports a significant number of its cars from the US, and the factory in the Netherlands, currently under construction, is the only manufacturing facility that is not based in the US.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the factory being built in the Netherlands will offer a certain degree of sourcing efficiency. The most obvious advantage to be anticipated is that it will no longer be necessary to transport cars from the US to Europe, thus saving Tesla Motors costs that would otherwise have been spent on logistics. Clearly, the business will have better access to the local infrastructure, which will allow it to more easily deliver cars to the locations where they are needed, simplifying distribution management. In addition, because European governments may tend to have a seemingly favorable attitude toward companies that create environmentally friendly products, it is possible that Tesla Motors will also be able to obtain additional benefits.\n\n### Contract Relations\n\nIt does not appear that contract relations had a crucial impact on the decision of Tesla Motors to operate in the global market, even though the company had a number of agreements with other corporations, whereby collaboration was conducted (Mangram 2012; Cheong, Song, and Hu 2016).\n\n## Tesla Globalization Strategy\n\n### The Global Value Network Used\n\n#### Producer chains\n\nTesla Motors produces and sells its own electric cars; the enterprise works as an original manufacturer, also creating components of cars that are then sold to other car makers. Tesla has strategic ties with a number of various suppliers that provide the company with different parts to be utilized in car production; for instance, the carbon fiber body panels used in the manufacture of the company\u2019s vehicles are bought from Sotira, a French company. On the other hand, certain components, such as Tesla\u2019s powertrain, are only built in the company\u2019s plants (Mangram 2012).\n\n#### Buyer chains\n\nThe company practices direct sales, that is, it does not engage in partnership with dealers to sell its cars. Tesla Motors attempts to sell its vehicles only in the stores owned by the company. In addition, customers may be able to order a car via an online purchasing procedure; they would need to visit a company\u2019s store only to complete the transaction and collect their new car. While in the US the company often experiences problems, due to the fact that sometimes direct sales may be legally banned in certain states (Stolze 2015), the business is able to practice direct sales successfully in a number of foreign countries (Edelstein 2014).\n\n#### Degree of market mediation\n\nIn different countries, the company has various degrees of market mediation, depending on the country. For instance, in the Chinese market, the company is sometimes faced with a decrease in demand for its vehicles, due to the fact that China is a very large country, and customers need to be able to cross long distances and still have the capability of recharging their cars. Therefore, the company is sometimes forced to employ market mediation in order to sell their product.\n\nHowever, with the creation of a larger number of Tesla Motors supercharging stations, this problem is gradually becoming less and less important, making Chinese clients more willing to purchase Tesla\u2019s cars (\u201cMusk reboots Tesla\u2019s China strategy\u201d 2015). On the other hand, in small European countries, there is no problem of range anxiety; in addition, the attention paid to environmental concerns is significant, so Tesla does not have to employ much market mediation.\n\n#### Relational networks\n\nTesla Motors engages in partnerships with other companies in order to purchase certain components from them, to work together on the development of new vehicles, or to sell certain components to them. The company even formed partnerships with some of its rivals (Cheong, Song, and Hu 2016). For instance, an alliance with Toyota was formed so as to jointly develop \u201celectric vehicles, parts, production systems, and engineering support\u201d (Mangram 2012, 299).\n\nThe company also formed alliances with such enterprises as Panasonic, Lotus Cars, and others. It is important to stress that Tesla\u2019s \u201cgigafactory,\u201d which is currently under construction, is supposed to be able to produce a large number of lithium-ion batteries, so many that Tesla Motors itself will not be able to build the quantity of vehicles necessary to use all these batteries (The Economist 2014). Therefore, it is clear that the business is planning to sell lithium-ion batteries to other manufacturers.\n\n### Organization and Global Division of Labor\n\nApproximately 13,000 employees work for Tesla Motors nowadays, but the majority of them are based in Fremont, California, in the company\u2019s manufacturing facility. The work related to manufacturing is carried out in this facility, while the work pertaining to key decision-making and management issues is also based in the US; in fact, the company\u2019s headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California (\u201cContact\u201d n.d.). In the rest of the regions, Tesla\u2019s activities are mainly related to the distribution and selling of the company\u2019s products.\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry, we can help!

[Click here to get started](https://ohmyessay.com/?cid=3431)!\n\nAs for the wages that the company\u2019s employees receive, it is stated that the CEO and chairman of the company Elon Musk earned only $37,584 in 2015. At the same time, the Chief Technology Officer had a salary of $250,560; the former Chief Financial Officer earned $339,300; the Vice President of Production made $1,144,845; the Vice President of Engineering received $3,115,708; and the Chief Financial Officer was paid $20,898,296 for 2015 (\u201cTesla Motors Inc: Compensation by Company\u201d n.d.). Therefore, it should be observed that the salaries of the top executives differ significantly, with that of the CEO and chairman of the company being approximately at the level of an ordinary worker. However, this may raise a certain degree of suspicion.\n\nThe company employs a very small number of women; most employees and all the top executives of the business are men. This might be due to the fact that relatively few females choose a career in technical professions (Wattles 2015).\n\n### Relationships with National Governments\n\nThe company has good relationships with national governments and does not engage in conflicts with them. The governments have a positive attitude toward the enterprise, due to the fact that it produces electric cars that are more environmentally-friendly than cars that work on gasoline or other similar fuels. In the US, the company was able to gain a number of benefits and subsidies from the government that allowed it to overcome financial difficulties and continue growing (Harkinson 2013).\n\nIn foreign countries, the business was also able to obtain a number of privileges from local governments. In Norway, for instance, the local government provided Tesla Motors with tax benefits; it is stressed that, thanks to the support from the government, Tesla has achieved a high rate of sales in that country (O\u2019Hara 2015). Some other governments also offered clients certain loan programs which made it easier for them to purchase the vehicles produced by this enterprise.\n\n## The Self-Representation of Tesla Motors and External Criticism\n\nThe author of this paper has not been able to find any significant claims that Tesla Motors runs \u201csweatshops\u201d or utilizes child labor. This can be explained by the fact that the production facilities of the enterprises are located in the US, and another one is being built in the Netherlands. In these countries, child labor and unsafe, unsatisfactory working conditions are not only banned by law, but this ban is also enforced.\n\nWhen it comes to the problem of pollution, Tesla Motors presents itself as an environmentally friendly enterprise, because electric cars do not need to burn gasoline, and therefore, do not emit greenhouse gases. In fact, the company obtains benefits from governments because of its products\u2019 being significantly more environmentally friendly than those of numerous other car manufacturers.\n\nOf course, the utilization of electric cars still can lead to the increased pollution of the environment and to harmful emissions, if the electricity used by the vehicle is produced by burning fossil fuels. However, it is not within the capability of Tesla Motors to control how the electricity is produced; this issue is within the responsibility of governments.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla Motors has been criticized for obtaining numerous benefits from governments. For instance, Harkinson (2013) points out that the subsidies which the company received from the authorities are, in fact, shouldered by taxpayers, and it is unclear why taxpayers should pay their own money in order to help some corporation to grow. However, the chairman and CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk responds to this by stating that these subsidies are not important to the enterprise (which appears rather doubtful), and that numerous other companies, including car manufacturers that produce gasoline-fueled vehicles, also often receive subsidies from the government (quoted in Hirsch 2015).\n\nThe latter part of this response appears reasonable as, due to the fact that Tesla Motors creates environmentally friendly vehicles, it might be possible to argue that the subsidies it receives are more reasonable than those provided for other car manufacturers. Thus, Musk redirects critics to the government; it is indeed unclear why taxpayers should shoulder the expenses of major corporations, but that also includes Tesla Motors, at least to a certain degree.\n\nAnother problem is related to the relationships of Tesla with its partners. In the UK, Tesla Motors was accused of attempting to bully Ecotricity, a British green energy company, and of trying to take over a few of this organization\u2019s locations in order to turn them into Tesla\u2019s charging stations; it is stated that the representative of Tesla Motors did not directly deny these efforts, but said that they \u201cwork with partners as needed\u201d (quoted in Vaughan 2014, 10). Therefore, it is clear that despite its reputation, Tesla Motors still may attempt to use some \u201cdirty\u201d methods for its own benefit in the market.\n\n## Conclusion: The Success of Tesla Globalisation\n\nIt should be stressed that Tesla Motors has only recently begun expanding internationally, but already has achieved a number of victories in foreign markets, in certain cases even becoming the leading brand. The main factor that contributed to its success is the use of innovative, environmentally friendly technologies, because environmental issues are a growing concern around the globe. It might be possible to forecast future success for the business if it keeps making an emphasis on the constant use of innovative technology.\n\nAs for the implication of this case, it is possible to state that in the contemporary world, the expansion into foreign markets might occur rather quickly. In addition, the ability to provide an answer to a global issue might allow a company to more successfully enter the international market.\n\n## References\n\n\u201cAbout Tesla.\u201d n.d.

Stanley Eitzen & Maxine Baca Zinn & Kelly Eitzen Smith", "Is Warren Buffett right about derivatives as weapons of mass destruction with regards to Tesla. Or is there an EV bubble? Hello all,\n\nGreetings from London.\n\nI would love to get some opinions on [this interesting piece on the \"Tesla-financial complex](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0)[\" in the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0).\n\nI found this article immensely fascinating and disturbing too. I have a few points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I think Warren Buffet & Charlie Munger will be proven right on the growing WSB-Gamestop-Robinhood gambling culture that seems pervasive. I was shocked that the article specifically mentioned Reddit. And, just a few days ago, someone messaged me on reddit about Alibaba saying \"the hedgies will have to cover their shorts\". I think the ridiculous culture and mania and language of WSB has more pronounced than people realise. And the use of leveraged-instruments to exacerbate a mania/bubble is exactly what Warren Buffett warned about in the 1990s.\n* Reading this article, there seems to be parallels with the crash of 1929. The widespread greed and speculation that has the power to spill into the broader market.\n\nI have pasted the article below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The \u2018Tesla-financial complex\u2019: how carmaker gained influence over the markets](https://www.ft.com/content/17f0cd1f-e751-4ddb-b13c-ea4e685b55c0)\n\nThe rally in Tesla\u2019s shares has lifted the overall stock market value of Elon Musk\u2019s electric carmaker to over $1.1tn, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. This year alone it has added almost $475bn in market capitalisation, equal to a Procter & Gamble, a JPMorgan \u2014 or two McDonald\u2019s.\n\nHowever, the real importance and wider footprint of what might be called the \u201cTesla-financial complex\u201d far outstrips the company\u2019s market capitalisation. This is thanks to a vast, tangled web of dependent investment vehicles, corporate emulators and an enormous associated derivatives market of unparalleled breadth, depth and hyperactivity.\n\nCombined, these factors mean Tesla\u2019s influence over the ebb and flow of the stock market is far greater than even its size would imply. It may even be historically unrivalled in its wider impact, some analysts say.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the language to describe Tesla any more,\u201d says Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s like explaining to a person in a two-dimensional world the concept of \u2018up\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla-financial complex is a phenomenon that many investors \u2014 whether passive index funds, traditional mutual funds, hedge funds or ordinary retail investors \u2014 have no choice but to contend with, given the idiosyncratic force it now exerts over the stock market.\n\n\u201cIt stands out like a sore thumb,\u201d says Dean Curnutt, the chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to pay a lot of attention to.\u201d\n\nOne of Tesla\u2019s oddest quirks is the fuel that has helped power its rocketing stock market value. Although its stock is wildly popular with many ordinary retail investors, the swelling size and hyperactivity of Tesla \u201coptions\u201d \u2014 popular derivatives contracts that allow investors to bet both on and against a stock and magnify any gains and losses \u2014 has also flabbergasted many market veterans.\n\nThe nominal trading value of Tesla options has averaged $241bn a day in recent weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That compares with $138bn a day for Amazon, the second most active single-stock option market, and $112bn a day for the rest of the S&P 500 index combined. This makes Tesla\u2019s stock more prone to whipsaw movements, because of the \u201cleverage\u201d inherent in using options to trade.\n\n\u201cThe Tesla options volume has always been outsized, but it is now huge,\u201d says Michael Golding, the US head of trading at Optiver, a firm active in the options market. \u201cTesla almost represents a generation. It\u2019s come to represent innovation, at a time when option trading has taken off.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla options market \u2014 more than 60 times as active as the entire FTSE 100 options market, and almost seven times greater than Euro Stoxx 50 options \u2014 has helped push US option trading volumes above actual stock trading volumes this year.\n\nTesla accounts for a big chunk of that aberration. In November options trading was 50 per cent higher than stock trading in nominal terms, and without Tesla and Amazon it would have been 20 per cent lower, according to Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe combination of a high market cap and extraordinary option activity make Tesla a critical driver,\u201d the investment bank said in a note.\n\nGolding estimates that historically the combined trading activity in US equity options has been between 10 and 20 times larger than activity in the biggest individual equity options market. However, there have been days recently where Tesla\u2019s option trading activity has been five-to-six times the rest of the S&P 500 options ecosystem combined. \u201cThe size of the Tesla options market is absolutely enormous,\u201d he says.\n\nThe value of options depend on what the underlying shares do, but due to their complex mechanics analysts say the option tail can occasionally wag the equity dog if there is enough activity in them, and even bleed into the broader stock market \u2014 adding to its churn and making it harder to navigate for many investors.\n\nCurnutt points out that it is unprecedented to have such a huge stock that is also so volatile, and moves to the beat of its own drum. For example, the swelling heft of Tesla\u2019s stock and options market is one of the reasons why the Vix volatility index has diverged so sharply from actual US equity market volatility lately, he argues. \u201cTesla is its own animal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changes how markets price risk.\u201d\n\n**Who will bet against Tesla?**\n\nOrdinary retail investors have been the primary power behind the Tesla options boom, but some of them have more resources to make bigger leveraged bets on Musk\u2019s company than others.\n\nIT billionaire Leo KoGuan recently said that he had by early November accumulated almost 7.2m shares in Tesla. They had largely been accumulated through aggressive purchases of Tesla call options \u2014 which give buyers the right to buy shares at a pre-agreed price within a certain time period \u2014 and offer a popular route to boost gains. Bloomberg previously verified the growing size of his direct equity stake and options investments, and in September, Tesla\u2019s investor relations head Martin Viecha confirmed KoGuan\u2019s original claim.\n\nThat would make him Tesla\u2019s third-biggest individual shareholder, behind Musk and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, with a stake worth almost $8bn, and has made him a hero on Reddit forums dedicated to the carmaker and trading. \u201cLeo KoGuan = Tesla God\u201d, one thread declared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trading a lot of options, we can definitely see his footprint in the market and he\u2019s inspiring others,\u201d Golding says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s waving the Tesla flag and people on Reddit see him as someone they can follow.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s fame and the volatility of its stock have also started to make it a component in some structured investment products, such as \u201cauto-callables\u201d, further enmeshing its shares into the fate of the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nAuto-callables are complex savings vehicles \u2014 particularly popular with Asian investors \u2014 where bankers construct an attractive, bond-like fixed return by selling stock options. Historically they have been mostly options on broad stock market indices such as the S&P 500, Hang Seng or Nikkei, but because of falling market volatility some bankers have started to structure them with options on choppier individual stocks. Tesla has emerged as a popular choice.\n\n\u201cTesla is perceived as safe because it is big and at the technological vanguard, but it\u2019s incredibly lucrative \\[for investors\\] to put into structured products because it is so volatile,\u201d says Simplify\u2019s Green.\n\nThe frenetic rally in Tesla has also buoyed money management groups such as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and Baillie Gifford, which have bet heavily on the electric carmaker. But there is a flipside. Its gains have left a huge and growing blot on the performance of many other investors with only negligible or modest positions in Tesla relative to its big heft in their benchmarks \u2014 or \u201cunderweight\u201d in market jargon \u2014 due to what many see as its wildly inflated valuation.\n\nUS mutual funds focused on growth stocks suffered their worst bout of underperformance in at least two decades in October, largely due to the carmaker\u2019s rally. For US mutual fund managers as a whole, Tesla alone crimped their relative performance by 0.46 of a percentage point in October, according to Wells Fargo analysts, helping turn what was heading towards being a decent year into yet another mediocre one for stockpickers.\n\n\u201cManagers that have been underweight Tesla have certainly been punished,\u201d says Drew Dickson, chief investment officer at Albert Bridge Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s been a sizeable driver of underperformance for many. You have to wonder whether a lot of them are now holding it simply due to fears they\u2019re going to lag.\u201d\n\nBetting against Tesla has been particularly painful. Hedge funds that have shorted Tesla shares over the past decade are sitting on cumulative losses of over $60bn, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics company. Just this year the losses have come to $11bn.\n\nThe \u201cshort interest\u201d in Tesla \u2014 the percentage of shares that have been lent out to and sold by hedge funds \u2014 has now fallen from 20 per cent at the start of 2020 to just 3.3 per cent by mid-November, according to S3. A sign, industry insiders say, that fund managers are now reluctant to risk their careers betting against a stock that has defied financial gravity for so long.\n\nProminent bears keep falling by the wayside. Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager made famous by author Michael Lewis in The Big Short and portrayed by Christian Bale in the film of the same name, last year called Tesla\u2019s stock price \u201cridiculous\u201d and revealed that he was shorting it. But in October he said he had ended the trade and closed out the short position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the original meme stock,\u201d says Green, referring to companies like GameStop that have gained sky-high valuations off the back of social media hype. \u201cShorting Tesla is just an ego trade at this stage. Tesla has been a primary contributor to destroying the credibility of active management over the past few years.\u201d\n\n**EV bubble**\n\nUnderscoring its financial idiosyncrasy, Tesla stock tends to not be much affected by other market and economic trends, but correlates somewhat with bitcoin, according to analysis by Quant Insight.\n\nAt the moment Tesla\u2019s shares seem to be benefiting from a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of factors, such as rising inflation expectations, tighter dollar conditions and uncertain credit markets, but \u201cTesla spends a lot of time out of \\[recognisable\\] macro regimes \u2014 unsurprising when it is often driven by idiosyncratic factors like Elon\u2019s tweets,\u201d says Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight. A macro regime is industry jargon for how different economic environments can hurt or help certain stocks or sectors.\n\nThe success of Tesla\u2019s stock has also helped inflate what some analysts and fund managers think is a broader bubble in anything related to electric vehicles. Tesla-emulators Rivian and Lucid are now valued at about $110bn and $90bn, respectively, despite having negligible revenues and no profits.\n\nAn index of EV and electric battery companies compiled by the FT has a combined market capitalisation of almost $1.8tn. In contrast, automotive giants Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai, the biggest car manufacturers in the world, are worth about $254bn, $135bn and $42bn, respectively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a big halo effect with anything electric vehicle-related at the moment, thanks to Tesla,\u201d says Benjamin Bowler, an equity derivatives strategist at Bank of America.\n\nEven Nikola, an electric truck start-up that has set aside $125m to settle fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that it misled investors about its technology, is still valued at $5.4bn. That is enough to qualify it for the blue-chip S&P 500 index \u2014 if it had ever made any profit.\n\nIf Tesla\u2019s ascent continues it will further enrich believers, hurt the dwindling band of doubters and drag swaths of the broader equity market up with it. But if it were to fall sharply, it could cause ripples through financial markets that are far in excess of what many appreciate.\n\nTesla did drop as much as 17.6 per cent in November before rallying once more, without the fall triggering any major ripples. But even this decline only took it back to its October level, and a bigger, more sustained drop could prove more impactful.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge, recursive \u2018tail wagging the dog\u2019 nature to the valuation of a lot of things these days,\u201d says Dickson. \u201cI\u2019m unwavering in my belief that ultimately the fundamentals are what matters. But over the past few years I can see that the short and intermediate term is far more dominated by flow, momentum, memes and appetites.\u201d\n\nHe recalls the financial analyst Ben Graham\u2019s adage that the stock market is a voting machine in the short run, but a weighing machine in the longer run. \u201cIn the current environment, I think we\u2019re spending a lot more time voting,\u201d says Dickson.", "Sat Nov 13 00:06:04 2021 NYSE:CEO / 120\n\n[If you're interested in a ipo metaverse play, with amazing fundamentals.

He is selling \"$10B worth of shares\" was news already. It's not news anymore.  It's also concerning how little some of y'all get how this works. I'll clarify. Musk is an insider at Tesla. He made the decision to sell these shares months ago. There are rules in place to stop market timing and they work like this: if Mr. CEO wants to sell shares (for whatever reasons... taxes, doubt, etc) he enters his trades months in advance. He can only sell once a quarter.  When the trade actually goes through, it is \"VWAP'd\". (Volume Weighted Average Price) Split up, because unless we're talking penny stocks, walking up and entering a trade for 5 million shares is going cause a price change. There just isn't enough instantaneous volume on the market to absorb that volume without a major price change, especially not for $1,200 per share Tesla.  In Musk's case, this is a multi-day VWAP, since there are literally SO MANY shares being sold. His broker is selling 100 share bunches ALL DAY and giving him the average price at the end of the day when it's all added up.  So this isn't me being a Tesla bear, but the lack of price collapse is not a sign of anything. It's the system doing what it's literally designed to. The price only dropped because OTHER sells drove it down on the news.

So\u2026 VW isn\u2019t even trying to catch up to Tesla because it can\u2019t. Tesla is continuing to innovate at a pace a company like VW is not capable of doing.

I just don't see where that growth is supposed to come from. It isn't as though most current major automakers aren't still going to be major players in fifteen years. And if they aren't, it's far more likely it's because they don't survive Apple's market disruption when that happens, not because Tesla has a flamboyant CEO.   From where I'm sitting, Tesla already has more competition than they can handle with Ford. The EV market isn't being ceded to Tesla, despite that having been priced in. Ford is swimming in preorders for their F150 Lightning. Cybertruck is way behind, at risk of cancellation. Reviewers like the Mustang Mach-E. *Motor Trend* like it almost as well as Tesla Model Y, and *Car and Driver* like it better.  GM, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, VW, BMW, and Kia are probably all planning on playing in the space, among others.  I understand Tesla's value (or lack thereof). What I don't understand is its price.

Here\u2019s my analysis on chipotle:    1.\t\u20602600 stores currently with a plan to reach 6000 stores with growing AUV from 2 million to 3.5 million long term by 2030. Almost all of the stores are in the United States with a few in Canada and even less in the UK so international expansion is still wide open for them. On their latest call, Niccol said that they are still testing the European market but signs are looking good for further expansion into the EU (mostly the UK and France for now).  2.\t\u2060Piper Sandler came out with a teen survey that said Chipotle was one of the restaurants they would choose the most, alongside Chick Fil A and Starbucks. The majority of Chipotles customers are under 34 and an even greater amount under 24. Their customers are expected to provide a greater lifetime value than other competitors with aging clientele. Young customers also prefer to pay for healthier, quality food versus overly processed foods.  3.\t\u2060The switch to digital as well as the addition of drive thrus boosts profit margin. Mobile ordering also helps stay connected with the younger customers along with data collection  to know the customer better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dip a toe into dark or ghost kitchens to move into areas where the financials of spending a 1-2 million dollars for a physical store don\u2019t make sense. These dark or ghost kitchens will have huge margins. 4.\t\u2060Great management, great financials, no long term debt. Enough cash to pay off any remaining debt. FCF increasing. The physical stores typically pay for themselves around a year and a half. It isn\u2019t a franchise so they keep 100% of the 25% profit margin.  5.\t\u2060Moat. Very few people realize or believe their moat because after all they just make burritos. But McDonald\u2019s just does burgers, Starbucks just makes coffee and dominoes just does pizza. IMO and Morningstar\u2019s opinion they have a wide moat. I believe their moat comes in the form of brand value and pricing power. The chipotle brand is synonymous with quality, similar to Apple. When Apple has a product with a glitch or defect it makes the news where as other brands don\u2019t. When chipotle came out with the original Queso dip people didn\u2019t like it and it made the news. Mis steps for this company are few and far between with the quality of their food (here your probably thinking the food illness problem from a few years ago, I\u2019ll address that below). Because of the brand value, Inflation and price hikes don\u2019t affect the customer loyalty as customers are willing to pay for quality. When they added Carne Asada, they increased the price .25 cents and saw \u201cno degradation\u201d in demand \u201cat all.\u201d Price increases may affect McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and other competitors more as their entire business model is to provide as much cheap food for the lowest cost. Well that cost is crawling up with inflation so the value isn\u2019t as great as it once was. Along with the brand value created pricing power. Pricing power in rising prices without affecting demand but also in the price of the store locations. Strip mall and mall owners often give chipotle a deal on the lease or rent because they know chipotle will drive foot traffic which may help other businesses. A new store typically pays for itself in about a year and a half.  6.   The food poisoning issue seems to be behind them. Almost all large food chains have had their share of food poisoning issues (KFC, Jack in the box, Burger King and more) yet they\u2019re all still around. Chipotles was three years ago, which led to a new CEO with Brian Niccol who came from Taco Bell and is used to running large food chains and has since cleaned up the food illness problems. Long story short, I listened to a podcast with Steve Ells (the founder) where he explained that they disinfect every single item on the menu before it even gets to the store. For example, they boil avocados for 4 seconds to completely kill germs on the outside AND the inside which doesn\u2019t affect flavor (which is new from what they were doing).  7. They basically invented the fast casual form of restaurant. When a new company tries their business model it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe chipotle of\u2026\u201d   Risks that I see (I may miss something but I don\u2019t trust DD without any risks listed)  1.\t\u2060Like Apple\u2019s insistent demand of quality, any food illness problems will hurt their brand value more than others. Food illness is a risk for any restaurant but I believe the news is much more likely to make a big deal about chipotle\u2019s problems than a Taco Bell or other company because they commit themselves to quality. This will in turn crush chipotles brand loyalty. 2.\t\u2060The drive thrus are capital intensive and they haven\u2019t been proven to be successful yet. 3.\t\u2060The demand for superior ingredients are subject to hired risk from the suppliers prices. 4.\t\u2060Competition from other quick service restaurants. 5. The valuation is a lot higher than other restaurants but it\u2019s finding support around the 1790s range.    Obviously I\u2019m very bullish in chipotle. I think it\u2019s a great long term investment. I think a lot of people over look them because the business model is so simple but then again, so is Coca Cola\u2019s. It\u2019s also a lot sexier to tech.   When it comes to Portillo\u2019s, I love it. I grew up on it and in fact I\u2019m having it tonight. I got it shipped to my house since I don\u2019t live by one anymore. My main concern is whether they can teach people what Italian Beef sandwiches are since most people have never heard of it. I just think the upside of chipotle is greater than Portillo\u2019s.](/r/stocks/comments/qr3pha/your_favorite_restaurant_stocks/hk556ax/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 00:49:56 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[The CEO should start tweeting shit like \"Feelin' cute, might sell the company to Saudi Arabia later\" to get more news attention.](/r/stocks/comments/qqyg1b/rivian_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/hk61q4n/)\n\nNYSE:CEO DATE : Thu Nov 11 05:07:11 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Apart form Tsla, what other exclusively-battery-car companies have IPOed?

Introduction to Aptiv PLC and Its Role in the Automotive Technology Landscape\n\nAptiv PLC is a large global automotive technology supplier headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The company designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of advanced vehicle components, integrated systems, and software solutions for major automakers worldwide.\n\nAptiv's key product areas include advanced safety technologies, autonomous driving systems, connected services, data management platforms, and vehicle electrification solutions. The company also has a significant presence in the aerospace and defense industries through its subsidiary, Wind River Systems, which provides software and services for mission-critical intelligent systems.\n\nAptiv's customer base includes most of the world's leading automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and many others. In addition, through its Wind River subsidiary, Aptiv serves as a contractor for various government and military agencies, providing software and services for aerospace, defense, and other critical infrastructure applications.\n\nThe company has a strong global presence, with a workforce of over 200,000 employees across 120+ manufacturing facilities and 12 major technical centers in 44 countries. Notably, Aptiv operates a significant data center in China, which has raised concerns among some cybersecurity experts and policymakers about the potential for data privacy and national security risks.\n\nIn terms of market size, Aptiv is a significant player in the automotive technology industry. In 2020, the company reported net sales of $13.1 billion, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aptiv's market capitalization as of April 2023 stands at approximately $28 billion, reflecting its substantial market value and industry position. The company's Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, which includes many of the data-driven technologies discussed in this document, accounted for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2020, demonstrating the significant scale of these systems in modern vehicles.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, autonomous, and data-driven, Aptiv's role in the automotive technology landscape continues to grow. The company's vast array of sensors, software platforms, and data management systems are becoming increasingly central to the operation of modern vehicles, raising important questions about data privacy, security, and potential misuse that will be explored further in this document.\n\nHowever, Aptiv's involvement in government contracting and its operation of a data center in China add additional layers of complexity and concern to these issues. The company's access to sensitive government and military data through its Wind River subsidiary, as well as the potential for data hosted in its Chinese data center to be accessed by foreign actors, raise serious questions about the company's data practices and the adequacy of its security measures.\n\nThese concerns are particularly acute given the increasing importance of connected vehicle data for national security, critical infrastructure, and personal privacy. As policymakers and regulators grapple with the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of automotive technology, it is essential that the roles and practices of key industry players like Aptiv be subject to rigorous scrutiny and oversight.\n\nIn the following sections, this document will delve into the specific risks and concerns associated with Aptiv's data collection practices, as well as the broader implications of connected vehicle technology for personal privacy, public safety, and national security. By examining these issues in depth, we hope to contribute to a more informed and robust public dialogue about the future of automotive technology and the steps needed to ensure that its benefits are realized while its risks are effectively mitigated.\n\n1. Sensors, Systems, and Data Collection in Aptiv-Equipped Vehicles\n\nModern vehicles, especially those equipped with Aptiv's advanced technologies, contain a wide array of sensors, systems, and components that collect vast amounts of data and control various vehicle functions. These components are essential for enabling features like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving capabilities, connected services, and vehicle safety enhancements. However, they also raise important privacy, security, and safety concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data they collect and the control they have over the vehicle.\n\nSome of the key sensors, systems, and data collection components found in Aptiv-equipped vehicles include:\n\n* GPS (Global Positioning System): GPS sensors track the precise location of the vehicle at all times, generating a detailed record of the vehicle's movements and routes.\n* Cameras: Modern vehicles often include multiple cameras, both inside and outside the cabin. These cameras can capture video and images of the vehicle's surroundings, as well as the occupants inside the vehicle.\n* Radar and Lidar: Radar and lidar sensors use radio waves and laser light, respectively, to detect objects and obstacles around the vehicle. They generate detailed 3D maps of the vehicle's environment and are critical for ADAS and autonomous driving features.\n* Accelerometers and Gyroscopes: These sensors measure the vehicle's acceleration, braking, and turning movements. They provide data on the vehicle's motion and driving dynamics.\n* Biometric Sensors: Some advanced vehicle systems include biometric sensors that can monitor the driver's attention level, eye movements, heart rate, and other physiological parameters.\n* Microphones: Many vehicles include microphones for voice commands, hands-free calling, and in-cabin noise cancellation. These microphones can potentially pick up conversations inside the vehicle.\n* Infotainment Systems / Human-Machine Interface (HMI): Modern vehicles feature sophisticated infotainment systems, also known as HMIs, which serve as the central interface for the driver and passengers to interact with the vehicle's features and functions. These systems often include touchscreens, voice controls, and connectivity features like smartphone integration. HMIs can collect and store data on user preferences, usage patterns, and even personal information synced from connected devices.\n* Speaker Systems: Vehicle speaker systems, especially those with advanced features like active noise cancellation or personalized audio zones, can include embedded microphones that monitor the acoustic environment inside the cabin. While primarily used for enhancing audio experience, these microphones could potentially be used for eavesdropping if compromised.\n* Actuators: Vehicles contain numerous actuators that control various functions such as braking, steering, throttle control, and suspension adjustments. In modern vehicles, especially those with ADAS or autonomous driving features, these actuators are often controlled by electronic control units (ECUs) that receive input from various sensors and systems. While essential for vehicle control and safety, the ability to remotely manipulate actuators through compromised ECUs or control systems could pose serious safety risks.\n* Telematics Systems: Telematics systems transmit vehicle data wirelessly to remote servers for analysis and processing. This can include diagnostic information, usage patterns, and even real-time sensor data from the systems mentioned above.\n\nIt is important to note that as a tier-one supplier deeply integrated into the vehicle's systems, Aptiv has access to the data generated by these sensors and components without the explicit knowledge or consent of the end customers (i.e., the vehicle owners or occupants). This raises significant concerns about data privacy, ownership, and control. Customers may be unaware of the extent of data being collected by their vehicles and transmitted to Aptiv, and they may have limited insight into how that data is being used or shared.\n\nThe data generated by these sensors and systems is often highly personal and sensitive in nature. Location data, biometric information, in-cabin audio and video, and personal data from HMIs all raise significant privacy concerns. The ability to control vehicle actuators and manipulate vehicle behavior through compromised systems poses severe safety and security risks.\n\nFurthermore, the transmission and storage of this data, as well as the wireless interfaces used to communicate with vehicle systems, introduce additional vulnerabilities. Malicious actors could potentially intercept sensitive data, take control of vehicle functions, or manipulate vehicle behavior remotely.\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe next section will delve into some of the specific risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle sensor data, control systems, and the largely opaque data practices of automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv.\n\n1. Risks and Potential Misuse Cases Associated with Vehicle Data, Control Systems, and Supplier Access\n\nAs vehicles become increasingly connected, automated, and data-driven, it is crucial to carefully examine the types of data being collected, how it is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy and security, and how vehicle control systems are protected against unauthorized access or manipulation. The lack of transparency around Aptiv's data access and use heightens these concerns and underscores the need for robust regulations, oversight, and consumer protections in the automotive technology sector.\n\nThe risks and potential misuse cases associated with vehicle data, control systems, and supplier access can be broadly categorized into three main areas: remote viewing, remote communication, and remote sensing. Each of these areas presents unique challenges and threats to individual privacy, security, and autonomy.\n\n1. Remote Viewing\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of modern vehicle technology is the ability for connected systems to enable remote viewing of a vehicle's interior and surroundings. This capability is made possible by the numerous cameras and imaging sensors embedded in today's vehicles, which can capture detailed video and images both inside and outside the cabin.\n\nSome of the key risks and potential misuse cases associated with remote viewing include\n\n* Invasion of Privacy: In-cabin cameras can capture intimate details of a vehicle's occupants, including their facial expressions, behaviors, and personal belongings. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this video feed could enable severe privacy violations and potentially even be used for blackmail or extortion.\n* Stalking and Harassment: Real-time access to a vehicle's interior cameras could be exploited by stalkers, abusers, or other malicious actors to monitor and harass their targets. This is particularly concerning in cases of domestic violence or obsessive behavior, where perpetrators could use remote viewing to track and intimidate their victims.\n* Corporate Espionage: In-cabin cameras could also be misused for corporate espionage, particularly in cases where sensitive business discussions or negotiations take place inside a vehicle. Competitors could potentially gain access to confidential information by remotely monitoring a targeted vehicle's interior.\n* Voyeurism and Exploitation: The ability to remotely view a vehicle's interior could also enable disturbing cases of voyeurism and sexual exploitation. Bad actors could potentially hack into vehicle camera systems to spy on occupants in compromising situations or even record and distribute intimate footage without consent.\n* Surveillance and Monitoring: Remote viewing capabilities could be exploited by governments, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies to conduct invasive surveillance and monitoring of targeted individuals or groups. This could have chilling effects on freedom of speech, association, and political dissent.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers like Aptiv implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to vehicle camera systems. This should include strong encryption, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for clear regulations and guidelines around the use of in-cabin cameras and remote viewing capabilities. This should include strict limits on when and how these features can be used, mandatory disclosure to vehicle occupants when they are being recorded, and robust protections against misuse by law enforcement or government agencies.\n\nConsumers should also be empowered with meaningful control over the cameras and imaging sensors in their vehicles, including the ability to physically disable or cover these components when not in use.\n\nUltimately, while remote viewing capabilities may offer some benefits in terms of safety and convenience, the risks to individual privacy and security are significant. As such, the development and deployment of these technologies must be approached with the utmost caution and transparency, and with the rights and interests of consumers as the top priority.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any of these points or if you have any other suggestions for this section on remote viewing risks. I'm happy to refine the content to ensure it comprehensively addresses the key concerns.\n\n1. Remote Communication\n\nAnother significant risk associated with connected vehicle systems is the ability for remote communication and interaction with a vehicle's internal components and control systems. This includes the capability to update firmware, modify software settings, and even directly control physical actuators like brakes, throttle, and steering.\n\nThese remote communication channels present a wide array of potential attack vectors and misuse cases:\n\n* Malicious Firmware Updates: By compromising the firmware update process, a hacker could potentially install malicious code onto a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs). This could allow them to manipulate vehicle behavior, disable safety features, or even take complete control of the vehicle remotely. Such attacks could be carried out at scale, targeting entire fleets of vehicles simultaneously.\n* Disabling Safety Systems: Hackers could exploit remote communication vulnerabilities to disable critical safety systems like airbags, anti-lock brakes, or electronic stability control. This could be done for malicious purposes, such as causing accidents or facilitating other crimes, or as part of a larger terrorist attack or act of cyberwarfare.\n* Targeted Attacks and Assassinations: The ability to remotely control a vehicle's acceleration, braking, and steering could enable terrifyingly precise targeted attacks. Hackers could potentially cause a specific vehicle to crash, allowing for nearly untraceable assassinations or \"accidental\" deaths.\n* Ransomware and Extortion: By gaining remote control over a vehicle's systems, hackers could effectively hold the vehicle and its occupants hostage. They could demand a ransom payment in exchange for releasing control of the vehicle, or threaten to cause an accident if their demands are not met. This could be particularly effective against fleet vehicles or those belonging to high-value targets.\n* Bot Networks and Distributed Attacks: Compromised vehicles could be used as part of a larger botnet or distributed attack network. Hackers could harness the collective computing power and connectivity of many vehicles to conduct large-scale denial-of-service attacks, mine cryptocurrencies, or spread malware to other connected systems.\n* Theft and Hijacking: Hackers could exploit remote communication channels to unlock and start vehicles remotely, enabling sophisticated theft schemes. They could also potentially hijack vehicles in motion, taking control away from the driver and rerouting the vehicle to a desired location.\n* Privacy Breaches: By accessing a vehicle's communication systems, hackers could potentially intercept sensitive data transmissions, including personal information, location data, and even audio from in-cabin microphones. This could enable identity theft, stalking, or other privacy breaches.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with remote communication are not just theoretical. In a deeply concerning incident, it was revealed that private keys used to secure vehicle communication systems were leaked online. These keys, if obtained by malicious actors, could potentially grant unauthorized access to thousands of vehicles, enabling the kinds of attacks and misuse cases described above.\n\nThe leak of these private keys underscores the urgent need for more robust cybersecurity measures and more transparent disclosure of potential vulnerabilities by automotive technology suppliers. It also raises serious questions about the industry's ability to safeguard the integrity of vehicle systems and protect consumers from cyber threats.\n\nThe risks posed by remote communication vulnerabilities, combined with the demonstrated reality of critical security failures like the leaked private keys, present a grave threat to public safety and national security. As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, the potential impact of these attacks will only continue to grow.\n\nRegulators, industry stakeholders, and the cybersecurity community must come together to address these risks head-on, through a combination of stronger regulations, more robust technical safeguards, and greater transparency and accountability from automotive technology suppliers.\n\nThe leaked private keys incident should serve as a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry, and a catalyst for more aggressive action to secure vehicle systems against cyber threats. This should include a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the leak, as well as a comprehensive review of cybersecurity practices across the industry.\n\nUltimately, the risks associated with remote communication in connected vehicles are complex, multifaceted, and rapidly evolving. Addressing these risks will require sustained collaboration, innovation, and vigilance from all stakeholders. The stakes could not be higher, and the time for action is now.\n\n1. Remote Sensing\n\nIn addition to the risks associated with remote viewing and communication, connected vehicles also present significant concerns related to remote sensing capabilities. Modern vehicles are equipped with a wide array of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors, which can gather detailed information about the vehicle's surroundings and occupants.\n\nFrom a malicious actor's perspective, these remote sensing capabilities could be exploited for a variety of nefarious purposes, posing serious threats to personal privacy, public safety, and even national security:\n\n* Surveillance and Tracking: By accessing a vehicle's external sensors, malicious actors could potentially track the movements of targeted individuals or groups with unprecedented precision. This could enable intrusive surveillance by governments, law enforcement, or private entities, undermining personal privacy and civil liberties.\n* Psychological Operations (PSYOPs): The data gathered by a vehicle's sensors could be used to build detailed psychological profiles of individuals based on their driving habits, frequented locations, and social interactions. This information could be exploited for targeted propaganda, manipulation, or blackmail, enabling sophisticated psychological operations at scale. Moreover, in a disturbing scenario, a malicious actor could potentially use a vehicle's sensors and control systems to actively manipulate the driving experience, causing intentional distress or even fear in targeted individuals. For example, by subtly altering the vehicle's handling, braking, or acceleration, an attacker could create a sense of unease or anxiety in the driver, making them more susceptible to manipulation or coercion. In more extreme cases, an attacker could potentially use a vehicle's systems to create overtly frightening or dangerous situations, such as causing sudden, unexpected braking or swerving, or even staging apparent near-misses or collisions. By inducing a state of heightened stress and fear, an attacker could potentially influence a targeted individual's behavior, decision-making, or even mental health over time. The use of connected vehicles as a tool for psychological manipulation represents a chilling evolution of traditional PSYOPs tactics, enabling a level of targeted, personalized, and persistent influence that has never before been possible. The implications of this for personal autonomy, mental well-being, and even political stability are deeply concerning.\n* Fingerprinting Nearby Devices: A vehicle's wireless communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, could be used to scan for and fingerprint nearby electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices. This could allow for the tracking and identification of individuals based on their digital footprint, even if they are not directly connected to the vehicle.\n* Health Data Exploitation: Some vehicles are equipped with biometric sensors that can monitor a driver's heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological parameters. If accessed by unauthorized parties, this data could be used to infer sensitive health information about individuals, enabling targeted advertising, insurance discrimination, or even blackmail.\n* IoT Device Hacking: A vehicle's sensors could potentially be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in nearby IoT devices, such as smart home appliances, wearables, or industrial control systems. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to these devices, steal sensitive data, or even cause physical harm.\n* Situational Awareness and Control: By aggregating data from multiple vehicles' sensors, malicious actors could gain a highly detailed and real-time understanding of traffic patterns, crowd movements, and other environmental factors. This situational awareness could be used to coordinate terrorist attacks, disrupt emergency response efforts, or even control the flow of people and goods in a given area.\n\nThe risks associated with remote sensing are particularly concerning given the increasing sophistication and range of sensors being integrated into modern vehicles. As autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, the amount and granularity of data collected by these sensors will only continue to grow, amplifying the potential for misuse and abuse.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential that automotive technology suppliers and manufacturers implement robust data security and privacy safeguards. This should include strict access controls, encryption of sensor data both at rest and in transit, and secure over-the-air update mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to sensor firmware.\n\nThere is also a need for clear regulatory guidelines and oversight regarding the collection, use, and sharing of vehicle sensor data. Consumers should be given transparent notice of what data is being collected by their vehicles, and have the ability to opt-out of data collection for non-essential functions.\n\nFrom a national security perspective, the risks posed by remote sensing underscore the need for proactive engagement and collaboration between the automotive industry, cybersecurity researchers, and government agencies. This should include the development of robust threat intelligence sharing mechanisms, as well as joint efforts to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities in vehicle sensor systems.\n\nUltimately, the remote sensing capabilities of connected vehicles present both immense opportunities and significant risks. Realizing the benefits of these technologies while mitigating their potential for harm will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, guided by a shared commitment to security, privacy, and the public good.\n\nAs we continue to navigate this complex and rapidly evolving landscape, it is crucial that we remain vigilant to the risks posed by remote sensing and other emerging automotive technologies. By working together to address these challenges head-on, we can build a future in which the transformative potential of connected and autonomous vehicles is realized, without compromising the safety, security, and privacy of individuals and society as a whole.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe rapid evolution of automotive technology, driven by advances in connectivity, automation, and data analytics, is transforming the transportation landscape and creating new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and safety. However, this transformation also poses significant risks and challenges, particularly with respect to data privacy, cybersecurity, and national security.\n\nThis document focuses on the role of Aptiv PLC, a major global automotive technology supplier, in the development and deployment of connected vehicle technologies. With a wide range of products and services, including advanced safety systems, autonomous driving solutions, and data management platforms, Aptiv is at the forefront of the automotive technology revolution.\n\nHowever, Aptiv's extensive data collection practices, enabled by the sensors and systems it supplies to major automakers worldwide, raise serious concerns about privacy, security, and potential misuse. The company's access to sensitive vehicle data, including location information, biometric data, and in-cabin audio and video, could enable invasive surveillance, targeted attacks, and psychological manipulation if not properly safeguarded.\n\nMoreover, Aptiv's role as a government contractor through its Wind River subsidiary, as well as its operation of a data center in China, add additional layers of risk and complexity. The potential for sensitive government and military data to be compromised, or for vehicle data to be accessed by foreign actors, underscores the urgent need for robust oversight and regulation of the automotive technology industry.", "Hyllion DD - puzzle pieces ready to be laid down and become a success Updated DD!\n\nThis is an update on the first DD analysis I shared  yesterday. I know, my Reddit account if fairly new. After reading DD's for the pas 6 months, I now set out to write my first one to share it. I am available for any feedback you have!\n\nHyliion has the potential to become a long-term player in the environmental Class 8 power stations & solutions in the North-American market. The valuation is currently driven by hype, news and future predictions, the actual company value is too hard to calculate. I think that with the current SP the stock has more upside potential than downside risk.\n\nThe great thing about the disrupting Hyliion technology, is that it doesn't disrupt current ways of working too much. Combining the Hyliion technology with their (intendent) partnerships set them up for success while making use of the current market without high investments. I think the company has all the parts ready to lay down the puzzle. However, it still needs to lay down the two most important pieces; orders & production in order to to live up to the current value.\n\nStarted as a trailer based solution, fleets asked to put the technology on trucks. Payback is faster due to a higher utilization rate. Hyliion focuses on the core of the Class 8 truck; the power solution. Although it has shifted its attention to the tractor, Healy (CEO, founder) sees the trailer application as eventually more suited for international use and some segments in the United States.\n\nThe current power solution leaves the chassis, design and driver's space up to the existing manufacturers and client specifics. This is great, as a potential customer can easily compare the investment and pay-back period. The potential customer is not being limited in their desires and choices regarding current models/brand, luxury or any other customization.\n\nWhen it comes to the hardware nothing is being manufactured by Hyliion. They use available parts from their strategic partners; Dana & Toshiba. They only add their technology and customer centric solutions. To secure their pipeline and technology they have acquired Gentherm battery systems in 2018. The press release said that Gentherm was continuing the battery solutions to others as well. The pitch deck does not mention this, or takes it into account in the business case.\n\nThe Hyliion technology is highly recognized by their key partner, Dana. The value of their 65 patents is hard to calculate. They use their patents to develop two different systems;\n\n* Hybrid powertrains (Diesel / CNG)\n* Hypertruck ERX (RNG)\n\nThe Hybrid powertrain has been tested since 2017, 20 units have been made and are being used / tested / demonstrated at the moment (partly by paying customers). It achieves up-to a 30% reduction in fuel use due to three factors; 15% through the e-axe hybrid technology, 12% from the system\u2019s APU, and 3% from tractor aerodynamics. Although they mention Diesel hybrid powertrains on their website and provide a business case, this type does not get any publicity anywhere.\n\nThe Hypertruck ERX is recently developed and is expect to start testing in 2021. Agility has placed the order of 1000 units on this type. The power station can use up to 100% renewable natural gas (RNG), which has a net negative carbon omission. This is the big midterm/long-play, and is still covered in uncertainty as real testing will start this year.\n\nHyliion develops the technology with the truck driver in mind; they want the driver to love driving the truck, while maximizing the efficiency. They do this for example with a game, which gives points to the driver depending on their drive (economical) drive style. According the feedback the drivers like this, while it is not distracting.\n\nThe BC scalability is achievable when it comes to the installation of the Hyliion power system. Hyliion has signed  LOI's with two manufacturing and service providers. Spreading installations over multiple facilities and partners will reduce the impact a growing Hyliion will have on the supply chain and available capacity. This comes with a need for good trainers/instructions and a risk of less quality.\n\nWith the partnerships and outsourcing, there are risks involved. Hyliion will have less control on the supply chain and delivery lead-times. Being the party who brings all the parties together will require a good communication and cooperation structure. The biggest risk with outsourcing, is loosing the control on your technology. With using standard items and having patented technologies, I think outsourcing does not poses too much risks compared to the advantages. One of the key advantages; limited risk on share dilution.\n\nThe addressable market is 800 billion $ (8 mln trucks in operation, 944k yearly sold). The sales projection looks like a great consultant calculation, and way too positive (from 300 truck in 2021 to 34,000 in 2024. However, I do believe there will be opening-up possibilities along the way (software sales, data analytics).\n\n**Strategic partnerships - Dana**\n\nTheir part supplier is also a big investor and a vocal supporter of Hylion. I think that Dana introduced Hylion at Idealease to set up a demonstration possibility to its customers. They really see Hyliion as a software company; \"they (Hyliion) brought a lot of software competency. And we brought a lot of electromechanical systems competency and knowledge,\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe went through a lot of analysis with them, and a lot of the software value that they bring to the table,\u201d Ryan Laskey, Dana senior vice president of commercial vehicle drive and motion systems, told FreightWaves. \u201cThat\u2019s really where we viewed more of a partnership model with them than being \\[just\\] an investor. We felt we worked well together.\n\n\u201cOur investment thesis was around the Hyliion software being able to read terrain and optimize the batteries on a truck to really maximize fuel economy,\u201d Laskey said. \u201cWe try to get into as many areas as we can. But we\u2019re not going to be experts in every area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are definitely in this for the long haul,\u201d Laskey said. \u201cWe view this as a solution that we can offer our long-haul customers because we think their systems paired with our motors, inverters and e-axles can meet our customers\u2019 immediate needs for fuel efficiency.\u201d\n\nWith a strategic partner, who is a global leader in the drivetrain systems, saying this is more valuable than having a marketing team (which I am doubting they have, as you'll read below).\n\n**Beta test partners**\n\nOne of the major advantages Hyliion has over its competitors is that its Hybrid CNG technology has been on the road and is being tested by customers for more than 4 years.\n\nIn 2017 Hylliion announced three developments partners; Ryder Fleet Management Solutions, PAM Transport and Mesilla Valley Transportation. Each of them used a Beta version for a longer period. At the start, all three of the companies showed interest in the technology and its benefits in the media (as is usual when starting such a program I'd say).\n\nThe thing that worries me, is that none of the three beta test partners were mentioned as partner on the pitch deck. It seems that these test trucks are not in use anymore. As they are the companies that have tested the system (a beta version though), I would have liked and expected to see them ordering one (or more) real version trucks.\n\n**Manufacturing partnerships**\n\nHylliion has two manufacturing partners, Fontaine modification and SV Lonestar Electric, where they have a non-binding LOI with. Both can/will take care of the supply of parts, installation of the Hyliion systems, has capacity available and takes care of the delivery to the customer.\n\nThe LOI's shows me that Hyliion doesn't have an appetite of investing in their own workshops or production lines. I like the fact hat Hyliion is having talks and is cooperating with suppliers who are each other competitors. As the LOI's are non-binding, the wait is for a definite agreement. However, without neither confirmed orders this can also be a bit of chicken-and-the-egg play.\n\nFontaine Modification is North America's most comprehensive provider of post-production truck services with center located next to OEM manufacturing plants. In the past (2014) they have installed CNG systems for Mainstay Fuel Technologies (currently momentum fuel tech). This shows as well that CNG systems are not new, hopefully timing is now better to scale-up. They show a picture of two Hyliion trucks next to the part \"Hybrid solutions\". Interesting thereby, the parent company of Fontaine is Marmon Highway Technologies, which in turn is a Berkshire Hathaway company.\n\nLonestar electric, an installer of powertrains in rolling chassis and glider trucks, provides services to Hyliion since 2019. Lonestar is also a partner of Dana.\n\n**Customers**\n\nC.A.T. has ordered their 5 trucks, after a demonstration/test possibity organized by Hiller Truck Tech. To me, this is a great example of how this system can sell itself.\n\n* Some big-name fleets, including Groupe Robert, C.A.T., Loblaw, Challenger, The Beer Store, municipalities and others are expected to attend the two-day demonstration, Hiller said.\n\nIn an interview on the Wegmans site, they make great publicity for the Hylion system;\n\n* \u201cOn average, we\u2019re seeing a 65% savings on fuel costs per truck when using natural gas. And we expect to keep the trucks in service longer \u2013 seven to 10 years, compared to five years for a diesel,\u201d\n* \u201cUntil now, we could only use diesel trucks to pull tandem sets,\u201d said Matt Harris, Wegmans fleet maintenance department manager. Wegmans began working with Hyliion in 2018. \u201cWith this one hybrid-electric CNG truck, we\u2019ve flipped that on its head.\u201d\n\nEagle transport has tested a truck before buying two;\n\n* \u201cWe\u2019ve tested it, and we have seen that it improves fuel mileage,\u201d Collette says. \u201cWe believe it will work best in our chemical operation.\u201d\n\n|**Customer**|Hyliion power systems|Frame|Since|Total class 8 trucks|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Wegmans food store|2|Volvo|Sep-20|175|\n|C.A.T.|5|Cascadia|Oct-20|100|\n|Penske Truck Leasing|3||Feb-20|Lease company|\n|Mone transport|1||Nov-20|\\-+30|\n|C.R. england|5||May-19||\n|Eagle transport corporation|2||Sep-19|500|\n|Idealease|3|International LT Series|Aug-20|Lease company|\n|Hiller Truck Tech Inc.|1|2015 Freightliner Cascadia|Jun-20||\n|NW Natural|1||Apr-20||\n|Return-It: Encorp Pacific|1||Sep-20||\n|H-E-B|1||Not offical|600|\n|Total|24|||1305|\n\nInteresting; there is a picture on the Hyliion FB (19 march 2020) which shows the sales dashboard in the back, zooming in provide you the sales customers at that time. It shows for example Wegmans, while that customer got introduced only in September. Oh I would love to see that sales dashboard now!\n\nIt is highly likely there are more customer and existing customers with more Hyliion systems. They do show potential customers in their pitch deck. To my opinion they are quit reasonable in dropping (big) potential customer names, while give notice that they would like to do business with them (Bonitas thinks differently).\n\n**Potential customers**\n\nThere are lots of potential customers. One particular to mention is UPS, which clearly shows the investments being done in CNG;\n\nAfter a previous 190 mln $ investment in CNG, UPS has invested another 130 mln $ in 2019. This investments includes 400 semi-tractors and 330 terminal trucks and five more fueling stations. None of the equipment is provided by a partner of Hyliion unfortunately. Since august 2020, UPS is testing the eCascadia. In the past UPS has tested a number of different alternative fuels and drivetrains in its fleet, including three Toyota and Kenworth jointly developed fuel cell electric heavy-duty truck. Thereby, the pitch deck shows the logo of UPS first in the target customer section.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nLooking at the pictures on the Hyliion FB, it shows one happy Hyliion family doing nice activities besides work. They have some nice drone videos, showing driving trucks with Hyliion logo's. And some interviews with Healy. That is basically the marketing they have been doing.\n\nThough their (informal) networking is probably much more beneficial, shareholders, customers and other parties are being influenced by marketing. In my opinion they should be always there when something happens involving Hyliion or environment-friendly power train solutions. They do not have to go the Tesla / Nikola way; Healy looks more the Bill Gates type (nerdy, friendly guy who nobody sees as potential risk with a great vision).\n\nFollowing video has been made and shared by a happy customer. I like the video, but it let me ask the question; \"where is the Hyliion marketing/sales/account manager?\". It could be the perfect promotion video for Hyliion, whereby all stakeholders are together and positive; customer, truck leasing, (local)  government & Hyliion.\n\n[https://youtu.be/8OSxOvhkmhI](https://youtu.be/8OSxOvhkmhI)\n\n**Competitors**\n\nThe Hyliion pitch deck shows they have no competitors in the Hybrid CNG / electric space. Theoretically this is true, as they are the (patented) owner this technology. In real life, they could be competing with truck manufactures which provide CNG engines. And those are numerous; as in almost all the truck makers. I do not know if this are two different markets, or if there is overlaps.\n\n**Shorts**\n\nThere is one party, Bonitas research, who is vocational shorting the Hyliion stock. In their report (Oct 2020) they share some food for thinking. However, I don't know why this company has \"research\" in its name when it states as disclaimer; \"all statements contained herein are the opinion of Bonitas Research LLC (\u201cBonitas\u201d) and are not statements of fact.\"\n\nKey opinions from Bonitas, and my feedback;\n\n* Dana is working on their own Electric power train solution, without Hyliion technology\n   * As evidence they show a picture of an European Electric truck; clearly different market\n* PAM transport, one of the beta testers, noted in an interview; \"The goal is for a 30% improvement in fuel economy, and so far, the savings has only been a small percentage.\"\n   * In the same interview PAM transport mentions following as well:\n      * Petitt (PAM) expects the test to continue through the life of the truck\n      * PAM looks to send the truck to the North-East. Petitt expects the rolling hills of the Northeast to allow for improved fuel economy.\n      * Pettit said drivers have enjoyed the auxiliary power the batteries offer because they can operate the air conditioning or heating systems without having to run the engine.\n   * The report does not includes the interview of the Wegmans manager where he makes a lot of positive comments, off course..\n* Gentherm technology acquired by Hyliion for only US$ 698,000, not being revolutionary\n   * Difference should be made between; price and value. It could be a great deal!\n   * Technology does not have to be revolutionary, it has to fit in the system\n   * 1 manager from the Gentherm who is blackmailing Hyliion through the 12-page report, I can imagine the feeling when you sold for 7 ton cash 2 years a go and not for shares...\n* Warranty / risk with purchasing Hyliion system\n   * I can not imagine there would be a transport company who does not check the warranty/insurance before buying a 30K solution..\n\n**Valuation**\n\nIn 2020 their net loss was slightly below 40 mln $. This is including 15.5 mln $ paid on interest and the extinguishing of debt; those costs will not come back in 2021. When not taking the debt into account (net loss of 24,5 mln $), Hyliion invested 50% of their expenses in R&D while 40% where costs regarding sales & operations. This looks to me that they control their budget properly.\n\nWith a SP of 11 $ the company has a market capitalization of 1.9 bln $. On the balance sheet (31 dec 2020) they have practically zero debt, while they do have 600 mln $ in current assets. This means the enterprise value is around 1.3 mln $.\n\nAt this moment Hyliion has a lot of free cash on hand to invest in marketing, growth, R&D and/or acquisitions. Based on their previous spending, I am confident they will use this amount in an effective way. Meanwhile the risk on dilution is very limited (considering the current low SP & cash on hand).\n\n**Other factors**\n\nThere are many other factors which will influence the (grade of) success of Hyllion. Many of them are hard/impossible to influence or to foreseen. The fact that Hyliion proposes practical and possible solutions in the current market (Hybrid Diesel / CNG), with a longer term product (Hypertruck ERX) works well with me. In future (depending on how the it works out), I foresee that they are flexible to change to hydrogen, fuelcell technology or trailer solutions. In other words; getting a monopoly on environment friendly Class8 truck power supply for the North-American market. Factors to be taken into account;\n\n* Subsidy\n* Diesel / CNG costs\n* Economy\n* Interest rate\n\n\\---\n\nI have a (small) long position in Hyliion of 135 shares with an average price of 16$ (current price 11$). I am a bit positively biased, however I am also not blind of negative or uncertain factors.\n\n(some) sources:\n\n[https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer)\n\n[https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/article/21688410/fontaine-modification-to-install-cng-systems-from-mainstay-fuel-technologies](https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/article/21688410/fontaine-modification-to-install-cng-systems-from-mainstay-fuel-technologies)\n\n[https://www.fontainemodification.com/electric-and-alternative-fuels](https://www.fontainemodification.com/electric-and-alternative-fuels)\n\n[https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/natural\\_gas\\_stations.html](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/natural_gas_stations.html)\n\n[https://www.ttnews.com/articles/ups-invests-130-million-natural-gas-vehicles-infrastructure](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/ups-invests-130-million-natural-gas-vehicles-infrastructure)\n\n[https://www.trucknews.com/sustainability/canadas-first-natural-gas-electric-hybrid-to-be-demonstrated/1003141822/?fbclid=IwAR0TiKxyN2JU9VuE2sCRrVhu8x2mEPlkyNjQzc6iWAqL2G6a1-9cE2Ht1Tk](https://www.trucknews.com/sustainability/canadas-first-natural-gas-electric-hybrid-to-be-demonstrated/1003141822/?fbclid=IwAR0TiKxyN2JU9VuE2sCRrVhu8x2mEPlkyNjQzc6iWAqL2G6a1-9cE2Ht1Tk)\n\n[https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/)\n\n[https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/14940128/fleets-respond-to-cng-tandem-hauling-capabilities](https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/14940128/fleets-respond-to-cng-tandem-hauling-capabilities)\n\n[https://eepower.com/news/hybrid-electric-retrofit-for-class-8-trucks-saves-up-to-30-on-fuel/](https://eepower.com/news/hybrid-electric-retrofit-for-class-8-trucks-saves-up-to-30-on-fuel/)\n\n[https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/14940128/fleets-respond-to-cng-tandem-hauling-capabilities](https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/14940128/fleets-respond-to-cng-tandem-hauling-capabilities)\n\n[https://www.bonitasresearch.com/company/hyliion-nyse-hyln/](https://www.bonitasresearch.com/company/hyliion-nyse-hyln/)\n\n[https://talkbusiness.net/2019/05/p-a-m-hybrid-electric-truck-to-be-tested-in-northeast/](https://talkbusiness.net/2019/05/p-a-m-hybrid-electric-truck-to-be-tested-in-northeast/)\n\nThanks for the feedback on my first DD u/pakman604 u/smakabottni u/larrygruver", "Hybrid Car Insurance Discounts and Top Models in the US  \n\n# Hybrid Car Insurance Savings: Discounts, Models, & Risks Explained\n\n  \n**Disclaimer:** The information provided in this article is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered professional advice.

However, beyond their sustainable benefits, owning a hybrid car can also unlock significant cost savings through **hybrid car insurance discounts**. As the automotive industry continues to innovate with [**Semiconductor Innovation**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-qualification-requirements.html) and [**Automotive Technology**](https://www.insurista.net/2023/12/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-guide.html), understanding the intricacies of these discounts can help hybrid owners maximize their savings while embracing a greener lifestyle.\n\n## Hybrid Car Insurance Discounts:\n\nInsurance companies recognize the inherent advantages of hybrid vehicles, such as improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and advanced safety features. As a result, many insurers offer [**hybrid car insurance discounts**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/maximize-hybrid-car-insurance-discounts.html) to incentivize drivers to make eco-friendly choices and mitigate potential risks associated with these vehicles.\n\nThe factors that influence insurance premiums for hybrid cars are multifaceted. Safety features, such as collision avoidance systems, anti-lock brakes, and advanced airbag technologies, play a crucial role in determining the level of discount offered. Insurers view these safety enhancements as risk-mitigating factors, potentially leading to lower claims and reduced repair costs in the event of an accident.\n\nFurthermore, driving habits are a significant consideration when calculating insurance rates for hybrid owners. Studies suggest that individuals who choose hybrid vehicles tend to exhibit more responsible driving behavior, covering fewer miles and being less likely to engage in risky practices on the road. This reduced risk profile can translate into substantial savings on insurance premiums.\n\nQuotes from industry experts underscore the importance of these factors:\n\n>\"Hybrid cars are often equipped with advanced safety technologies that can help prevent accidents or mitigate damage in the event of a collision,\" says Xavier Sabastian, an auto insurance expert. \"Insurers recognize this and may offer discounts to hybrid owners as a result.\" \\[Source: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/hybrid-car-insurance](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2525374199617559544/6609446269825725513#)\\]\n\nReal-world examples showcase the tangible benefits individuals have experienced by choosing specific hybrid models or leveraging available discounts. Emma, a Tesla Model 3 owner, enjoys an 8% discount on her $1,500 premium, saving around $120 annually. Similarly, John, who drives a Toyota Prius, receives a 6% discount on his yearly premium, reducing his costs by $90.\n\n## Most Expensive to Insure:\n\nWhile hybrid vehicles generally offer insurance savings, some models can be more expensive to insure than others. For instance, the Audi RS6 Avant Quattro can cost up to $3,922 annually to insure, making it one of the most expensive hybrid models in the US market.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the higher insurance costs associated with these models. The repair costs for specialized components and advanced technology found in high-end hybrids like the Audi RS6 Avant Quattro can be substantial, driving up insurance premiums. Additionally, the theft risk for these expensive vehicles is heightened, increasing insurance rates.\n\nInsights from industry experts shed light on this phenomenon:\n\n>\"The higher price tag and complex equipment of electric cars can result in increased repair or replacement costs, impacting insurance premiums,\" explains Tim Derham, CEO at Universal Casualty. \\[Source: [https://www.universalcasualty.com/blog/high-insurance-costs-for-electric-cars/](https://www.universalcasualty.com/blog/high-insurance-costs-for-electric-cars/)\\]\n\n## Least Expensive to Insure:\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some hybrid models are among the least expensive to insure in the US market. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV stands out as a cost-effective option, with annual premiums varying across different insurance companies.\n\nFactors contributing to lower insurance premiums for these models include their impressive safety ratings and affordability. Hybrids with high safety ratings are considered less risky to insure, leading to reduced premiums. Additionally, models like the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which are more affordable in terms of pricing and repair costs, can result in lower insurance rates due to the decreased financial risk for insurers.\n\n## Specific Makes and Models:\n\nWhen it comes to popular hybrid models, the Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion Hybrid, and Chevrolet Volt are among the most recognizable names in the market. These vehicles offer varying annual insurance rates depending on the insurer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l6h13i7p3pc1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3180a80a6398418fd0b67c885d2a99dfae1a0cc3\n\n* **Toyota Prius:** USAA offers insurance for the Prius at $1,201 per year.\n* **Ford Fusion Hybrid:** Liberty Mutual provides coverage for the Fusion Hybrid at $1,777 annually.\n* **Chevrolet Volt:** Nationwide insures the Volt at an average of $1,349 per year.\n\nQuotes from industry experts highlight the importance of considering a hybrid model's safety record and longevity in the market when seeking insurance discounts:\n\n>\"As hybrids become more popular, insurance companies are increasingly likely to offer discounts to hybrid drivers,\" says Xavier Sabastian. \"This trend is driven by the fact that hybrid drivers typically cover fewer miles and are considered safer on the road, leading insurers to consider passing on discounts to them in the future.\" \\[Source: [https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2023/01/16/637854.htm](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2023/01/16/637854.htm)\\]\n\n## Potential Risks and Considerations for Hybrid Vehicle Insurance\n\nWhile hybrid cars offer numerous benefits, including potential insurance discounts, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks and considerations associated with insuring these vehicles. By understanding these factors, hybrid owners can make well-informed decisions and mitigate any potential pitfalls.\n\n**1. Higher Maintenance Costs** One of the primary considerations for hybrid vehicle owners is the potentially higher maintenance costs compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Hybrid vehicles incorporate complex technology, including battery packs and electric motors, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Regular maintenance and specialized service requirements may also contribute to increased ownership costs over time. \\[Source: [https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrid-electric-vehicles/the-cost-of-maintaining-a-hybrid-car/](https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrid-electric-vehicles/the-cost-of-maintaining-a-hybrid-car/)\\]\n\n**2. Coverage Limitations** It's essential to carefully review your insurance policy and understand any coverage limitations or exclusions that may apply to hybrid vehicles. Some insurers may exclude or limit coverage for certain components, such as batteries or electric motors, which could result in unexpected out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim.\n\n**3. Availability of Qualified Repair Facilities** Finding qualified repair facilities equipped to handle hybrid vehicle repairs can be a challenge, particularly in certain regions. This can lead to longer repair times and potentially higher costs if vehicles need to be transported to specialized facilities.\n\n**4. Battery Replacement Costs** The battery pack is a crucial component of a hybrid vehicle, and its replacement can be a significant expense. As batteries age and degrade over time, owners may face substantial costs for replacement, which could impact the overall cost of ownership and potential insurance premiums.\n\n**5. Resale Value Considerations** While hybrid vehicles generally hold their value better than traditional gasoline-powered cars, their resale value can be impacted by factors such as battery condition and the availability of newer, more advanced models. This may influence insurance costs and should be considered when evaluating long-term ownership costs.\n\nTo mitigate these potential risks and considerations, it's essential for hybrid vehicle owners to:\n\n* Research and compare insurance policies from reputable providers, ensuring comprehensive coverage for hybrid-specific components and risks.\n* Maintain regular maintenance schedules and follow manufacturer recommendations for optimal performance and longevity.\n* Locate qualified repair facilities in their area and familiarize themselves with the repair process for hybrid vehicles.\n* Budget for potential battery replacement costs and factor them into the overall ownership expenses.\n* Stay informed about the evolving hybrid vehicle market and consider resale value implications when making purchase decisions.\n\n## Maximizing Savings:\n\nTo maximize insurance savings as a hybrid owner, exploring various practical tips can prove invaluable. One effective strategy is bundling policies, such as combining auto insurance with home or renters insurance. Insurers like State Farm and Allstate are known for offering competitive rates for bundled policies, allowing hybrid owners to capitalize on significant discounts.\n\nAdditionally, hybrid owners should actively seek out [**hybrid-specific discounts**](https://www.insurista.net/2024/01/tips-negotiating-hybrid-car-insurance-discounts.html) offered by insurers. These discounts can range from 5% to 10% and may increase based on responsible driving habits and continued ownership of a green vehicle. For example, Geico provides a 5% discount for hybrid owners, while Travelers and Farmers offer a 10% discount.\n\nMaintaining safe driving habits is also crucial for securing affordable insurance rates. Obeying speed limits, avoiding distractions, and maintaining a clean driving record can qualify hybrid owners for the lowest possible rates.\n\nReal-world examples illustrate the potential savings:\n\n* Emma, a Tesla Model 3 owner, enjoys an 8% discount on her $1,500 premium, saving around $120 annually.\n* John, a Toyota Prius driver, receives a 6% discount on his yearly premium, reducing his costs by $90.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nAs the automotive industry continues to evolve, embracing sustainable practices and [**Design Solutions**](https://www.insurista.net/2023/12/hybrid-car-insurance-discounts-state-specific.html), hybrid vehicles offer a compelling combination of eco-friendliness and cost savings through insurance discounts. By understanding the factors influencing these discounts, such as safety features, driving habits, and vehicle models, hybrid owners can make informed decisions to maximize their savings while contributing to a greener future.\n\nInsurers recognize the benefits of hybrid vehicles and are increasingly incentivizing their adoption through attractive discounts. By exploring bundling options, leveraging hybrid-specific discounts, and maintaining responsible driving practices, hybrid owners can significantly reduce their insurance costs and enjoy the financial rewards of embracing a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nAs the demand for hybrid and electric vehicles continues to grow, consumers need to stay informed about the evolving insurance landscape and the potential savings available.

The near-monopoly China has in producing the world\u2019s supply of rare earths has been well-known among industrial users for years. \\(Jason Lee\\/REUTERS\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/36ta697xrw2c1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=b64c365db74bfa0c206258aef264a44f95d4ab9b)\n\nThe deepening of the Israel-Hamas war in late October overshadowed profound new findings from the International Energy Agency (IEA). \u201cThe transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it\u2019s unstoppable,\u201d said IEA executive director Fatih Birol, as the agency released its latest annual [*World Energy Outlook*](https://www.iea.org/news/the-energy-world-is-set-to-change-significantly-by-2030-based-on-today-s-policy-settings-alone) report. The report details how the rapid rollout of green technology now under way will transform a major portion of the global energy system by 2030.\n\nEven the most ardent environmentalists until recently might have considered that unrealistic. And yet an accelerated renewable energy transition \u2014 an unmistakable good \u2014 will produce new political and economic fault lines as demand for critical minerals skyrockets. In a fragmenting world trying to stave off climate catastrophe, the fight over these prized commodities promises to be equal parts necessary and destabilizing.\n\nManufacturing a [single electric car](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/minerals-used-in-electric-cars-compared-to-conventional-cars), for example, requires more than 200 kilograms of combined copper, lithium, nickel, manganese, cobalt, graphite, zinc and rare earth elements, compared to less than 35 kilograms of just copper and manganese for an internal combustion model. The IEA [forecasts](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) that meeting the Paris climate agreement\u2019s goal of keeping average global warming well below 2\u00baC above pre-industrial temperatures will result in a quadrupling of demand for critical minerals by 2040. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would mean a sixfold increase.\n\nBut while not geologically scarce, these materials are already in short supply. This stems from their versatility as integral components of nearly all modern technologies \u2014 not only within clean tech, but also in consumer electronics, communications and medical equipment, advanced weapons systems and the supercomputers needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI). Some large deposits of critical minerals are also hard to access, given their location in increasingly fragile states.\n\nGoing forward, corporations\u2019 profit seeking will be buoyed by insatiable market demand \u2014 a dynamic interlinked with the growing energy and national security concerns of geopolitical rivals. This constitutes a volatile mix. Safeguards must be created to ensure human rights don\u2019t become collateral damage in the process.\n\n# The China Dilemma\n\nThrough its role as the world\u2019s factory over the past quarter-century, China has come to dominate critical mineral supply chains. The country is by far the leading primary source or value-added refiner of [cobalt](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheet_Cobalt.pdf), [copper](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheets_copper.pdf), [graphite](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheet_Graphite.pdf), [lithium](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheet_Lithium.pdf), [neodymium](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheet_Neodymium.pdf), [nickel](https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETC_Materials_Factsheet_nickel.pdf) and more. Likewise for rare earth elements \u2014 a group of 17 metallic substances needed in trace amounts for production of numerous dual-use technologies. Such a stranglehold over key inputs for decarbonization, military supremacy and the industries of tomorrow gifts Beijing significant political leverage. China\u2019s unrivalled capacity to mass-manufacture solar panels and lithium-ion batteries will also enrich its coffers as the green transition gains pace.\n\nThis has serious foreign policy implications. Given China\u2019s growing [diplomatic clout](https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2023/06/23/saudi-iran-deal-a-test-case-of-chinas-role-as-an-international-mediator/), appeals to dismantle Western hegemony, and expertise at wielding state-owned enterprises to finance and execute infrastructure projects, the green transition could reinforce the country\u2019s status as the preferred development partner in much of the Global South. If so, renewable energy projects will become another tool for Beijing to reshape international systems in favour of authoritarianism. They will also supply a benevolent narrative for the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP\u2019s) propaganda machine to drown out criticism at home and abroad.\n\nWestern countries have belatedly grasped how reliant they are on China for critical minerals fundamental to their security and prosperity. In the wake of the pandemic-era supply chain disruptions and [energy insecurity](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/energy-insecurity-climate-change-geopolitics-resources) sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, critical minerals \u2014 especially in processed form \u2014 represent another vulnerable chokepoint for liberal democracies.\n\nDespite fevered rhetoric from nationalist hawks, the global economy\u2019s interdependencies preclude a hard decoupling between China and the West. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has [called](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/07/07/asia-pacific/us-china-economic-decouple-impossible/) it \u201cvirtually impossible.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister has [dismissed](https://www.dw.com/en/french-minister-says-decoupling-from-china-unrealistic/a-66387720) it as \u201can illusion.\u201d The vice-president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, Victor Gao, echoed this sentiment in September in an op-ed for China\u2019s state-owned *Global Times*, which mostly channels the foreign policy views of the ruling CCP. \u201cDecoupling between China and the US is similar to any attempt to decouple the earth and the moon,\u201d Gao [wrote](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202309/1297414.shtml). Trying to disentangle the world\u2019s two largest economies, he cautioned, would invite \u201cdisaster both for China and the US, as well as for the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nStill, the theory is that China could throttle Western access to these materials in the event of a spiralling trade war with the United States or military confrontation over Taiwan. For evidence, many observers point to 2010, when China reportedly blocked rare earth exports to Japan for two months after the captain of a Chinese fishing vessel was detained by Japanese officials following an incident at sea.\n\nA new [study](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/revisiting-china-japan-rare-earths-dispute-2010) from the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research casts doubt on this version of events, calling it \u201cfolklore.\u201d Nevertheless, the *People\u2019s Daily* \u2014 a CCP mouthpiece \u2014 warned in 2019 that China could sever rare earth supplies to American companies in response to Chinese telecom giant Huawei being blacklisted by the Trump administration. \u201cWaging a trade war against China, the United States risks losing the supply of materials that are vital to sustaining its technological strength,\u201d an [editorial](http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/0529/c90000-9582572.html) said. The United States imports nearly three-quarters of its rare earth supply from China.\n\nBeijing\u2019s decision to [ban foreign direct investment](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243515.shtml) in rare earth mining projects as of January 1, 2022, has injected even more urgency into efforts by the West to diversify critical mineral supply chains. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce then imposed further restrictions in early August, this time on exports of [gallium](https://features.csis.org/hiddenreach/china-critical-mineral-gallium/) \u2014 of which the country produces 98 percent of the world\u2019s raw supply \u2014 and germanium, two metals vital for making computer chips.\n\nCritical minerals are abundant throughout the Western world, particularly in Australia, Canada and the United States. The problem is that mining projects have long lead times and are notoriously difficult to execute because of capital requirements, regulatory burdens, environmental protections and bureaucratic inertia. In Canada, which possesses enormous mineral wealth, the federal government\u2019s new [Critical Minerals Strategy](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/nrcan-rncan/site/critical-minerals/Critical-minerals-strategyDec09.pdf) admits it can take five to 25 years for a mining project to become operational and generate revenue. Some don\u2019t even materialize after years of effort and investment. Mineral refinement poses a further challenge, given the energy intensity and toxic by-products inherent in the process.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, mining domestic deposits alone may be insufficient for Western countries to meet their needs. Filling the gap created by a serious pivot away from China will require governments and businesses from the industrialized world to engage their counterparts in emerging markets. And many of these nations are now embracing [resource nationalism](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/03/26/the-transition-to-clean-energy-will-mint-new-commodity-superpowers) in an effort to dictate terms of trade to foreign clients.\n\nEarlier this year, the government in Chile, home to the world\u2019s largest reserves of lithium, announced plans to nationalize the industry. In Indonesia \u2014 on pace to become the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy by 2030 \u2014 the government banned exports of nickel ore in 2020. Two years earlier, Jakarta [appropriated gold and copper mines](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Commodities/Indonesia-mine-nationalization-shakes-top-copper-producer) from a leading American metals company. Zimbabwe has prohibited the export of raw lithium since December 2022. The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union\u2013Patriotic Front hopes that drawing value-added manufacturing projects can jump-start growth in a moribund economy that has cratered under the weight of Western sanctions and chronic hyperinflation.\n\n# The European Union, South Korea, the United States and others are already [scrambling to sign infrastructure and mining agreements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/eu-courts-africa-in-early-push-to-counter-chinese-spending) across Africa to compete with China\u2019s entrenched presence there. Over the past two decades, China has issued at least\u00a0[$170 billion](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/)\u00a0in debt across more than 1,200 loans to African governments and their state-owned enterprises. Mining has been the third-most targeted sector, behind transportation and energy. The head of the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency [told](https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/disinformation-soft-power-zimbabwe-china-lithium/) a reporter that six months after the country instituted its ban on unprocessed lithium, his agency had received at least\u00a0160 lithium investment applications\u00a0from investors based in China \u2014 in stark contrast to just five from the United States.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*\\*\\*Article shortened to meet reddit word limits\\*\\*\\*\\****\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# NOV. 27th, 2023, ~ Stellantis Battery Center Begins To Rise:\n\n# [Stellantis Battery Center Begins To Rise - CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/11/27/stellantis-battery-center-begins-to-rise/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbjy8rsdsw2c1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3bc04d4dfb432611863bc97a0b5f9a329909453\n\n# TIES RIGHT INTO YESTERDAY'S POST!\n\n[(10) #NIOCORP\\~ SCANDIUM TRAIL, AS STELLANTIS Aims For 50% Lighter Battery Packs plus a bit more.... : NIOCORP\\_MINE (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/184gmzr/niocorp_scandium_trail_as_stellantis_aims_for_50/)\n\nConstruction progress photos are nice. When it comes to EV charging stations, it\u2019s awesome to know how far along they are for future trips. When the company doesn\u2019t let people know what\u2019s going on, it can be a little maddening. Why? Because badly-needed infrastructure is something we all look forward to. As an EV driver, it directly affects what I can do with the EV.\n\nBut, there are some other kinds of economic infrastructure we should pay more attention to, because they also directly affect the EV experience, just like a charging station. Automotive factories are important, but they\u2019re just the end of the supply chain. Further up the chain, things like battery production facilities are a big deal. Further up the chain, battery research and development facilities live at the bleeding edge of technologies that we\u2019ll take for granted in the future.\n\n# That\u2019s why I thought some construction progress photos from Stellantis were pretty cool. The construction of the Stellantis North America Battery Technology Centre at the Automotive Research and Development Centre (ARDC) in Windsor, Ontario (right across the river from Detroit) is well underway. The facility will rely on 228 steel structural columns to stay upright, and these columns weigh in at over 800 tonnes, and the first ones are starting to spring up! With an impressive area of 100,000 square feet, the facility will house 35 walk-in climatic test chambers for testing up to 63 packs at the same time, along with 11 reach-in test chambers for testing up to 132 cells at a time. The facility will conduct tests within a temperature range of -40 degrees Celsius to +80 degrees Celsius, conditions most EVs will never or rarely see.\n\n\u201cAt Stellantis, we recognize the pivotal role that battery technology plays in electrifying the automotive industry. Our forthcoming North America Battery Technology Centre in Windsor will be key to design, test and produce class-leading products that will meet our customers\u2019 needs,\u201d said Ned Curic, Stellantis chief engineering & technology officer. \u201cWith multiple walk-in climatic test cells, we will rigorously evaluate batteries for pack testing, environmental durability tests, life cycle tests, and systems validation. This comprehensive testing process ensures our EV batteries are built to withstand the test of time, performing optimally in various conditions and accelerates bringing cutting-edge electric vehicles to our meet the needs of our customers.\u201d\n\nThe Battery Technology Centre will serve as the main battery research and development hub for Stellantis North America, focusing on the development and validation of advanced Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) cells, modules, and battery packs. With a storage area capacity of 120 EV Battery Packs, this state-of-the-art facility will also strengthen the ARDC\u2019s existing partnership with the University of Windsor, so the entities can collaborate on various testing projects with ease.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jdzrxyhsw2c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dbadfd4ec01e32a6b136111bd9804411f3ba37\n\n**The Battery Technology Centre is part of a significant overall investment of $3.6 billion CAD ($2.8 billion USD) that was announced by Stellantis in May 2022. This project has received support from all three levels of government in Canada. The construction is expected to be completed by mid-2024, followed by full-scale battery testing operations starting in the first quarter of 2025. This project will host approximately 55 new highly skilled positions, including engineers and technicians.**\n\n[In September, Stellantis celebrated the grand opening of its Battery Technology Center for Europe in Turin, Italy](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/12/stellantis-opens-new-battery-development-facility-aims-for-50-lighter-battery-packs/). This marks a significant milestone in the company\u2019s global battery development and manufacturing network, which the company says will include six gigafactories.\n\nAccording to the company, these ambitious projects reflect Stellantis\u2019 unwavering commitment to advancing battery technology for the electric vehicles of tomorrow. It is part of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan and long-term electrification strategy, which involves a staggering investment of $45 billion CAD ($35 billion USD) through 2025 in electrification and software on a global scale. So, the company is just getting started.\n\n*Featured image and plant rendering provided by Stellantis.*\n\n# NOV. 27th 2023, ~ FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Strengthen America\u2019s Supply Chains, Lower Costs for Families, and Secure Key Sectors:\n\n# [FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Strengthen America\u2019s Supply Chains, Lower Costs for Families, and Secure Key Sectors | The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-strengthen-americas-supply-chains-lower-costs-for-families-and-secure-key-sectors/)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pzv07303tw2c1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=b40178cc4fb5e0477ed28ef2403dd615f9c4a825)\n\n* **Energy and critical mineral supply chain readiness.**\u00a0To more consistently track risk and opportunity across energy supply chains, DOE is developing an assessment tool that accounts for raw materials, manufacturing, workforce, and logistics considerations.

NIOBIUM.... Hmmmm......\")\n\nToyota claims its solid-state batteries (or SSBs) will [allow its EVs to get up to 745 miles per charge](https://www.topspeed.com/toyotas-solid-state-batteries-745-miles/?utm_source=syndication). This is a longer range than most ICE vehicles. Perhaps more impressive than the long driving range is the short charging time. Toyota\u2019s solid-state battery can charge in 10 minutes or less. That brings the time required to recharge a car almost down to the level of refilling a gas tank.\n\n## The Problem With Fast-Charging\n\nWhile most batteries can be fast-charged at least a few times, sending in massive surges of energy is very harsh on them. (This is why the \u201ctrickle charger\u201d found in so many people\u2019s garages is so maddeningly slow.) If someone routinely fast-charges a battery, [its internal structures tend to break down](https://www.caranddriver.com/research/a31875141/electric-car-battery-life/?utm_source=syndication) after a disappointingly short while.\n\nThis is especially true if one repeatedly lets the battery get completely drained before recharging it. The first sign a battery is reaching the end of its life is when it simply doesn\u2019t hold a charge as well as it used to. If a battery continues to get drained and recharged at the end of its useful life, it can become dangerous.\n\n# Toyota's Upcoming Battery Factory In North Carolina\n\nToyota is planning to have electric or \u201celectrified\u201d versions of every vehicle in its lineup by 2030. It also plans to sell 5.5 million EVs by then. As proof of its EV plans, Toyota is [opening a battery factory in Liberty, North Carolina](https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-announces-2-5-billion-expansion-of-north-carolina-plant-with-350-additional-jobs-and-bev-battery-capacity/?utm_source=syndication). (The small town of Liberty lies between the larger cities of Raleigh and Greensboro.)\n\nThe facility, dubbed the \u201cToyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina,\u201d will open in 2025 and have fourteen production lines for producing different types of batteries for Toyota\u2019s hybrid and fully-electric vehicles.

Here are key aspects of engine oil:\n\n## Functions of Engine Oil:\n\n**Lubrication:** The primary function of engine oil is to lubricate the moving parts within the engine. This reduces friction between components like pistons, cylinders, and bearings, preventing wear and tear.\n\n**Cooling:** Engine oil helps in dissipating heat generated during combustion. It carries away heat from critical engine parts, preventing overheating and ensuring optimal operating temperatures.\n\n**Cleaning:** Engine oil contains detergents and dispersants that help keep the engine clean by preventing the accumulation of sludge, deposits, and contaminants. This ensures proper engine performance.\n\n**Sealing:** Oil forms a thin film on engine components, contributing to the sealing of gaps and preventing the leakage of combustion gases.\n\n**Corrosion Prevention:** Engine oil provides a protective layer on metal surfaces, preventing corrosion and rust.\n\n## Types of Engine Oil:\n\n**Conventional Oil:** Also known as mineral oil, this is the traditional type of engine oil derived from crude oil. It provides basic lubrication and is suitable for many common vehicles.\n\n**Synthetic Oil:** Formulated in a laboratory, synthetic oils offer better performance in extreme temperatures, provide superior protection against wear, and have longer change intervals compared to conventional oil.\n\n**Synthetic Blend:** This type of oil combines synthetic and conventional oils, providing some benefits of synthetic oil at a lower cost.\n\n**High Mileage Oil:** Specifically designed for vehicles with high mileage, this oil contains additives to address issues common in older engines, such as seal conditioning and reduced oil consumption.\n\n## Viscosity:\n\nEngine oil viscosity is a measure of its resistance to flow. It is denoted by a numerical code, such as 5W-30. The \"W\" stands for **winter**, and the number before it indicates the oil's viscosity at low temperatures, while the number after it indicates viscosity at high temperatures. Lower viscosity oils **0W-20** flow more easily in cold conditions, providing better cold-start protection.\n\n## Oil Change Interval:\n\nThe recommended interval for oil changes depends on factors like the type of oil used, driving conditions, driving habits and the vehicle's age. Many modern vehicles have oil life monitoring systems that determine the optimal oil change interval based on driving patterns.  You may **not even have a dipstick** to check the oil in your vehicle.\n\n## Oil Filter:\n\nDuring an oil change, the oil filter is typically replaced. It helps remove impurities and contaminants from the oil, ensuring clean oil circulates through the engine.\n\nRegular maintenance, including timely oil changes, is essential to keep an engine running smoothly and extend its lifespan. Always refer to the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for the appropriate oil type and change intervals.\n\nPennzoil, like many oil manufacturers, doesn't publicly disclose the specific details of their proprietary manufacturing processes.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general insights into how high-quality synthetic motor oils, like Pennzoil Ultra Platinum, are typically made:\n\n**Base Oil Production:**\n\n* Synthetic motor oils, including Pennzoil Ultra Platinum, often start with a base oil. This base oil can be derived from various sources, including crude oil, **natural gas**, or other synthesized materials.\n* For synthetic oils, the base oil is subjected to additional processes, such as hydrocracking and purification, to achieve the desired molecular structure and remove impurities. These processes result in a more uniform and stable base oil compared to conventional oils.\n\n**Additive Packages:**\n\n* Motor oil formulations include **additive packages** that enhance the oil's performance and protection capabilities. Additives may include detergents, dispersants, anti-wear agents, antioxidants, and viscosity modifiers.\n* The specific combination and concentration of additives are carefully formulated to meet industry standards and provide optimal protection for the engine.\n\n**Blending:**\n\n* The base oil and additive packages are blended together in precise ratios. The blending process ensures uniform distribution of additives throughout the oil, maintaining consistency and stability.\n\n**Quality Control:**\n\n* Stringent quality control measures are implemented throughout the manufacturing process. This includes testing the oil at various stages to ensure it meets or exceeds industry specifications and the manufacturer's performance standards.\n* &#x200B;\n\n[Fossil Fuel Extraction](https://i.redd.it/ujedc7sfmndc1.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCar manufacturers often provide **recommended oil change intervals** based on various factors, including the type of engine, the oil used, driving conditions, and advancements in engine technology. These recommendations can vary widely between different manufacturers and even among different models produced by the same manufacturer. It's crucial for vehicle owners to follow the specific guidelines outlined in their car's owner's manual.\n\nHere are some key points related to extended oil change intervals:\n\n**Advancements in Engine Technology:**\n\n* Modern engines often come equipped with advanced technologies, improved materials, and better oil formulations. These advancements contribute to engines that can operate efficiently for longer periods between oil changes.\n\n**Synthetic Oils:**\n\n* The use of synthetic oils has become more common. Synthetic oils generally have better thermal stability and resistance to breakdown compared to conventional oils, allowing for extended oil change intervals.\n\n**Driving Conditions:**\n\n* Extended oil change intervals are often recommended for vehicles operating under **normal driving conditions**. However, vehicles subjected to severe driving conditions, such as frequent **stop-and-go traffic, towing, or extreme temperatures**, may require more frequent oil changes.\n\n**Oil Life Monitoring Systems:**\n\n* Some vehicles are equipped with oil life monitoring systems that use sensors and algorithms to assess the condition of the oil. These systems provide more accurate guidance on when an oil change is needed based on the actual condition of the oil.\n\nWhile **extended oil change intervals** are becoming more common, it's essential for vehicle owners to monitor their oil levels regularly and adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations. **Neglecting** oil changes or using the wrong type of oil can lead to increased engine wear, reduced fuel efficiency, and potential long-term damage.\n\nIf you have concerns or questions about the recommended oil change intervals for your specific vehicle, it's advisable to consult the owner's manual or contact the vehicle manufacturer directly. They can provide guidance tailored to your vehicle's make, model, and engine specifications.\n\nDealerships and car manufacturers don't WANT your car to last a long time.  They have a warranty for 50 000 or 100 000 miles and when that is done they expect you to BUY a new car.  If you really want to ride you car for a long time, get to know your vehicle and the engine oil you use and examine the oil over the months you drive.  I use synthetic oil and they recommend changing every 15 000 km (9,0000 miles) for my 1998 Toyota Camry 2.2 liter.  The car with oil filter takes only 3.6 liters of oil, a little under a gallon.  There is NO WAY I am going to follow that interval!  I change the oil every 5000 km (3000 miles).  Luckily my car does not burn a drop of oil but modern cars often do burn a little oil and manufacturers call this \"normal\".  Since most people rarely check their oil and examine the condition and color, determine an oil chhange interval that works for you, based on your vehicle and your driving habits and where you drive.  Don't buy the hype of very long oil change intervals.  Changing the oil is cheap and keeps your engine in peak condition.  New engines are very expensive to buy and install.\n\n# Overfilling the oil in an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) can have several negative consequences:\n\n**Foaming:** When the oil level is too high, the crankshaft can whip the excess oil into a frothy foam. This foam is less effective at lubricating the engine components, leading to increased friction and wear.\n\n**Increased Pressure:** The excess oil can increase the pressure in the engine, putting additional stress on seals and gaskets. This may result in oil leaks.\n\n**Aeration:** Overfilled oil can introduce **air bubbles** into the lubrication system, leading to aeration. Air in the oil reduces its lubricating properties and can result in poor engine performance.\n\n**Increased Oil Temperature:** The extra oil can lead to higher oil temperatures. Elevated temperatures can cause the oil to break down more quickly, reducing its effectiveness as a lubricant.\n\n**Increased Load on the Crankshaft:** Overfilling can cause the crankshaft to experience higher loads as it tries to move through the excess oil. This can lead to increased friction and energy loss.\n\n**Catalytic Converter Damage:** If the excess oil finds its way into the exhaust system, it may damage the catalytic converter, reducing its efficiency.\n\n**Smoke and Poor Performance:** In extreme cases, overfilled oil can lead to excessive smoking from the exhaust and poor engine performance.\n\nTo avoid these issues, it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for oil capacity, including the oil filter,  and change intervals. If you accidentally overfill the oil, it's recommended to **drain the excess oil** to bring it to the correct level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Maintaining the proper oil level in an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is crucial for its proper functioning and longevity. Here are some dangers associated with low oil levels:\n\n**Poor Lubrication:** The primary function of engine oil is to lubricate moving parts within the engine. When the oil level is low, there may not be enough lubrication to adequately protect components like the crankshaft, camshaft, and connecting rods. This can lead to increased friction, wear, and heat.\n\n**Increased Friction and Heat:** Without sufficient lubrication, friction between metal components increases. This elevated friction generates more heat, which can result in overheating and potential damage to engine parts.\n\n**Engine Overheating:** Inadequate lubrication and increased friction can lead to overheating of the engine. Excessive heat can cause the engine to seize, resulting in significant damage.\n\n**Reduced Cooling:** Engine oil also plays a role in transferring heat away from critical components. Insufficient oil can compromise the cooling effect, contributing to elevated temperatures.\n\n**Engine Wear and Damage:** Low oil levels accelerate wear on engine components. Over time, this wear can lead to permanent damage and compromise the engine's overall performance.\n\n**Increased Fuel Consumption:** A poorly lubricated engine tends to work harder, leading to increased fuel consumption. This can result in reduced fuel efficiency and higher operating costs.\n\n**Oil Breakdown:** Engine oil has additives that help neutralize acids, disperse contaminants, and maintain viscosity. When the oil level is low, these additives can become depleted more quickly, reducing the oil's effectiveness.\n\n**Catalytic Converter Damage:** Low oil levels can cause oil to burn in the combustion chamber. The resulting byproducts may damage the catalytic converter, reducing its efficiency.\n\nTo avoid these dangers, it's essential to regularly check and maintain the proper oil level according to the manufacturer's recommendations. If you notice a consistent drop in oil levels, it's important to address the underlying issue, such as **leaks or excessive oil consumption**, to prevent long-term damage to the engine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oil Color Over Time](https://preview.redd.it/q4drjdmsondc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bd9fed04babfbd3dca2797d3272fb80e429dd75)\n\nThe color of engine oil on the dipstick can provide some information about the oil's condition, but it's essential to note that color alone doesn't tell the whole story. Here are some general guidelines regarding engine oil color:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Amber/Clear to Light Brown:** This is the typical color of new or well-maintained oil. It indicates that the oil is clean and has not picked up a significant amount of contaminants or particles.\n\n**Dark Brown/Black:** As engine oil ages and accumulates **contaminants**, it tends to darken. This is normal, and it doesn't necessarily mean the oil is ineffective. However, very dark or black oil may suggest that the oil is overdue for a change or that there could be an issue with the engine.\n\n**Milky/Cloudy:** If the oil appears milky or cloudy, it may indicate the presence of water or coolant in the oil. This can be a sign of a **leaking head gasket** or other coolant-related issues. In such cases, it's crucial to address the underlying problem promptly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Water or Coolant in the OIL](https://preview.redd.it/0pxuonmjrndc1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6c831b4ea7bad3e0fbd57dfcd29b94c31190283)\n\n**Metallic Shimmer:** If you notice a metallic shimmer in the oil, it could suggest metal particles in the oil, which may indicate **engine wear**. This situation requires further investigation, as excessive metal wear can be a sign of internal engine problems.\n\nWhile these generalizations can provide some insights, it's essential to consider the overall condition of the oil, follow the manufacturer's recommendations for oil change intervals, and conduct regular vehicle maintenance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Check Your Oil and Read the Dipstick](https://preview.redd.it/tdotpkvrsndc1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82200f674caefc4c4ee2aebc1975e18ed6c06b71)\n\nChecking your oil level using a dipstick is a straightforward process.

One drop of oil can ruin a lot of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After wiping the dipstick with a rag and withdrawing from oil pan](https://preview.redd.it/b33hvaoyvndc1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cfa2ff6df827d754e844c5c449fc09e6df2f83e)\n\nFor diesel engines, the oil will go black on your first ride after an oil change, so this chart does not apply to diesel vehicles.  Change the diesel oil at the milage recommended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oil Circulation](https://preview.redd.it/tz9jyy97undc1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32566aef87e958f1129a94903ac9efffb544b7f6)\n\nIn an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), oil circulates through the engine to provide lubrication, reduce friction, and dissipate heat. The process of oil circulation typically involves the following components and steps:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oil Pan:** The oil pan is located at the bottom of the engine and serves as the reservoir for the engine oil. It collects the oil that drains down from various parts of the engine.\n\n**Oil Pump:** The oil pump is responsible for drawing oil from the oil pan and pressurizing it. It then circulates the pressurized oil throughout the engine. The pump is usually driven by a gear or chain connected to the engine's crankshaft.\n\n**Oil Filter:** Before reaching critical engine components, the oil passes through an oil filter. The filter removes contaminants and impurities from the oil, ensuring that only clean oil reaches the engine.\n\n**Oil Galleries/Passages:** The engine has a network of passages or galleries that direct the pressurized oil to various components requiring lubrication. These components include the crankshaft, connecting rod bearings, camshaft, valvetrain, and other moving parts.\n\n**Main Bearings and Rod Bearings:** The crankshaft rotates within the engine block and is supported by main bearings. The connecting rods, which connect the pistons to the crankshaft, also have bearings. These bearings are lubricated by the circulating oil to reduce friction and wear.\n\n**Camshaft and Valvetrain:** The camshaft, responsible for opening and closing the engine's valves, is also lubricated by the circulating oil. The oil reaches the valvetrain to reduce friction and ensure smooth operation.\n\n**Piston Rings and Cylinder Walls:** The oil helps lubricate the piston rings, preventing excessive wear and providing a seal between the pistons and cylinder walls. This seal is crucial for maintaining compression and preventing exhaust gases from leaking into the crankcase.\n\n**Oil Return:** After lubricating various engine components, the oil returns to the oil pan by gravity. The cycle repeats as the engine operates.\n\nThis continuous circulation of oil is vital for maintaining the longevity and efficiency of the internal combustion engine. Regular oil changes are necessary to ensure that the oil remains clean and effective in its lubricating functions.\n\n[World Runs On Oil](https://i.redd.it/hs77mzrtundc1.gif)\n\nThe modern world is highly dependent on oil, and if there were suddenly no more oil on Earth, it would have profound and far-reaching consequences across various sectors.

Renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other technologies would likely see rapid development and adoption.\n\nIt's important to note that the complete absence of oil is an extreme scenario, and more realistic scenarios involve a gradual shift away from oil dependency as societies transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Efforts to diversify energy portfolios and reduce reliance on fossil fuels are already underway to address environmental concerns and promote energy security.\n\n**Plastic manufacturing** is heavily dependent on oil as a raw material. The majority of plastics are derived from petrochemicals, which are compounds obtained from petroleum or natural gas. Here's a brief overview of how oil is used in plastic manufacturing:\n\n**Feedstock for Petrochemicals:** Crude oil undergoes a refining process to produce various fractions, one of which is used as a feedstock for the production of petrochemicals. These petrochemicals, such as ethylene and propylene, serve as building blocks for many types of plastics.\n\n**Polymerization:** The petrochemicals obtained from oil are subjected to a process called polymerization. In this process, small molecules are chemically bonded together to form long chains known as polymers. Different types of polymers are used to produce a wide variety of plastics.\n\n**Additives and Blending:** During the manufacturing process, various additives may be introduced to enhance the properties of the plastic. These additives can include stabilizers, plasticizers, colorants, and reinforcing agents. The specific composition of additives depends on the intended use and characteristics of the final plastic product.\n\n**Molding and Shaping:** Once the polymer is formed, it is processed through molding or extrusion techniques to give it the desired shape and form. Different methods, such as injection molding, blow molding, and extrusion, are used based on the type of plastic product being manufactured.\n\n**End Products:** Plastics produced from oil-derived polymers are used in a myriad of products, including packaging materials, containers, bottles, toys, medical devices, automotive components, electronics, and more.\n\nThe dependence of the plastic industry on oil has environmental implications, including concerns about plastic pollution, waste management, and the carbon footprint associated with the production of petrochemicals. Efforts are being made to develop alternative sources for plastics, such as bio-based and recycled materials, to reduce the environmental impact of plastic manufacturing. Additionally, advancements in recycling technologies and the promotion of a circular economy aim to address some of the challenges posed by traditional plastic production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Incorrect Oil Adding!](https://i.redd.it/i4kb2my0yndc1.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Make it, Recycle it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# In 2018 it is estimated that 359 trillion kilograms of plastic was produced on the globe.  The first entirely synthetic plastic was created in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, who invented Bakelite. Each year the total plastic created  goes up.  Modern plastics are manufactured by petrochemical companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron,  Royal Dutch Shell,  BP (British Petroleum),  Sinopec, TotalEnergies,  Dow Chemical Company,  BASF,  LyondellBasell and Saudi Aramco.  These companies primarily use  raw materials like natural gas, crude oil, and other hydrocarbons derived from fossil fuels. These companies refine these materials into the building blocks for plastics.   The building blocks of plastics, such as polymers, are processed and combined with additives to form the specific type of plastic needed for various applications. These can be shaped into products like bottles, bags, containers, and countless other items.\n\n# Depending on how you calculate recycling, only 5-15% of plastic is recycled properly on the earth.  If petrochemical companies want to continue to ruin the planet, the least they can do is to make sure the plastic they make can be 100% recycled and recycled properly without the massive  guilt trip placed on the public.  You petrochemical companies made the plastic, you recycle it proper or don't make it at all!   Recycling PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) can be quite challenging due to their chemical structure and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bonds, which are extremely difficult to break and are called forever chemicals. These substances are pervasive in the environment and have been detected in various forms, including in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we consume. PFAS and certain plastic components have been detected in the womb and breast milk, perhaps we should be renamed the Naked Plastic Ape.      I suggest the banning of PFAS immediately in the plastic making industry and leaving the plastic straw alone, if it can be properly recycled, Mr Trudeau.  Aim higher than a drinking straw Mr Prime Minister, while you still have a job!\n\n# I wrote this letter to the editor but was denied publishing.  Can you handle the truth?", "LYDIA PROJECT Recycling Critical Metals from Fuel Cells **About Project:**\n\nLYDIA aims to commercialize low cost components (30% lower to  commercial) for hydrogen devices (fuel cell, electrolyzers) through  recycling end of life membrane electrode assembly (MEAs) and extraction of PGMs. The new LYDIA unit through a joint venture will recycle 3 M MEAs to produce 200 kg PGM electrocatalysts and 36000 m2 Nafion  membrane, to be applied in new MEAs and be utilized in the manufacturing  of low-cost green energy production devices for e-mobility.\n\n**Popular Project Description:**\n\nAn exponential growth of green energy production is projected by 2026 to account for 95% of the global power capacity increase,  following also the EU Green Deal plan for carbon neutrality by 2050. The  European Raw Materials Alliance targets to secure the critical raw  materials supply for Energy Storage & Conversion applications, such  as batteries, fuel cells, solar and hydrogen energy systems. LYDIA aims  to upscale a novel hydrometallurgical process to recycle platinum group  metals (PGM) and the Nafion membrane of the membrane electrode  assemblies (MEAs) of EoL Low Temperature and High Temperature fuel cells  and electrolysers.The recycled PGMs will be carefully separated to  develop catalysts for electrocatalysis and for HT-FC (High Temperature,  Fuel Cells) with PBI MEAs which will be applied in the automotive sector  with hydrogen as a fuel. The industrial operation will start right  after project ends, reaching a recycling capacity of ca 3 M MEA pieces  per year, and producing 200 kg of new electrocatalysts and 36000 m2  Nafion membrane, while further investments will be made to increase  production. The outputs will be commercialized through a joint venture  in the fuel cells and electrolysers market, with the participation of  ADVENT which recently received 782.1Million Funding from the Greek State for IPCEI Green HiPo Project for massive production of fuel cells  and overly reaching a market share of 6% in 2030.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f37144gdkkab1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=08f9ebe1d533fae43018166045dacd2b37b4b1bb\n\n**Background of the project:**\n\nThe 2020 EU Renewable Energy Directive set the limit for 10%  of EU transport fuels to come from renewable sources, paving the way for  the rapid growth of Fuel Cells and Electrolysers, whose combined  markets reached 371 M EUR in size in 2020 \\[1\\]-fig.0. Acidic polymer  electrolyte membrane (PEM) and alkaline (AEM) fuel cells are the most  promising technologies and have been already used in automotive market  (TOYOTA Mirai)\\[2,3,4\\] and space travels (Gemini/Apollo).\\[5, 6\\] More than  30,000 passenger fuel cell cars are on the roads globally, while PSA is  currently implementing plans to turn to fuel cell vehicle production.  However, the main reason that fuel cell cars have not reachedmassive  production and selling level globally, is high cost (TOYOTA Mirai has  x8 times higher cost than the same petrol passenger car due to high  price of PGMs contained in the fuel cell). On average, a fuel cell car  contains 30-60 g of PGMs, while the automotive catalyst contains a total  of 3-5 g of PGMs.Nevertheless, a large quantity of current PEM fuel  cells and electrolysers will have reached end-of- life by 2030 and, as  yet, there is no satisfactory process for recycling these high-tech,  composite assemblies. LYDIA recycling process for EoL MEAs from fuel  cells and electrolysers will be industrialized by MONO based on  technologies from previous projects (min TRL 5 as presented in technical  feasibility) i.e. MONO\u2019s PGM extraction technology at TRL 7, CNR  production/testing of electrocatalysts (TRL5), solvent extraction (TRL  5) by KUL to refine the PGMs to will be recovered as metal salts using  commercial processes, while CHEMOURS will recycle the Nafion membrane  for automotive applications . CHEMOURS will also develop new PBI-MEAs  and electrocatalysts with electrodes made from recycled PGMs. ADVENT as a  fuel cell manufacturer will incorporate the new MEAs (containing the  recycled electrode) to develop a low-cost single cell , which aims to the  automotive sector (end-user CRF).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ieufzg3fkkab1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=47807a0eaa4c2181f73186ab17522f38c944730f\n\n**Project objective and scope:**\n\n1.

Good question, automobile manufactures have gotten higher multiples (at least for a short time) based on producing, or moving closer to producing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and sometimes just by pretending they will change their name to emphasize Electrical terminology, and of course having a company named after the people who discovered how to make electricity work gets really high multiples (doesn\u2019t work for utilities named after Edison though). Toyota has been reluctant to move into the BEV space, did this change? Will they rename themselves after Alessandro Volta? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nFirst, I really want to thank the modern world that can take spoken Japanese from multiple speakers and convert that into written English so cheaply that I can read it on the internet without a paid subscription to anything! It\u2019s a wonderful time to be alive!\n\nOh, I guess it's fashionable to add a disclaimer so the black helicopters don\u2019t come and lock me in a bank vault without my reading glasses or something right? Fine, I make my living breaking big atoms into little atoms so nothing I say or type should ever be considered medical, financial, legal, or romantic advice. Good enough? Let\u2019s go.\n\nI can\u2019t find an old blog post I read in the 2009\u20132011-time frame to give credit, but it was pretty insightful, the blog author did a word search for \u201ccustomer\u201d in both the Amazon and IBM earnings call, and showed how Amazon (huge number of times saying \u201c*customer*\u201d) would be a better investment because that\u2019s where their focus was compared to IBM which had very few hits for \u201ccustomer\u201d.  I haven\u2019t checked, but I think Amazon has had slightly better returns than IBM from 2009-present.\n\nCTRL-F for \u201c*customer*\u201d returns **53 hits** for TM, things like:\n\n>\u201cAnd Toyota is always listening to customers, always trying to develop products that are suitable for every part of the world. And we have to remember that the goal is not electric vehicles. The goal is carbon neutrality. And even if we have the best technology, if it's not chosen by customers, it will not have the impact of reducing emissions and that's the reason why we've chosen to have a full lineup, and we've invested in all of these technologies.\u201d\n\nCompare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call shows just **10 hits** for \u201c*customer*\u201d with things like:\n\n>\u201cwe had not yet begun customer deliveries\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cwhat we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201ccontinue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles\u201d\n\nQuite a difference in company philosophy!\n\nStarting off with the prepared statement, this company is a beast! Their fiscal year begins and ends in March so this is for the entire Covid year without the benefit of the Jan-March 2020 pre-Covid or the reopening time after vaccinations ramped up, this is the worst possible time period and the sold 9.087 Million vehicles (96% of 2019 numbers) under the Toyota/Lexus name and an additional 7.646 Million consolidated vehicles (85.4% of 2019 numbers).\n\nQuick note, they use the term \u201celectrified vehicles\u201d to include Hybrid (HEV), Plug in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell electric (FCEV). The sales of electrified vehicles were 112.3% of 2019, which I think were mostly HEVs.\n\nThey went through all the various gains and losses to operating income (currency exchange rates, marketing, cost reductions) and overall operating income went UP by 10 Billion (JPY not USD). Then announced the dividend at a payout ratio of 29.8%. Announced a resumption of share buybacks (had been suspended during the pandemic) of up to 250 BILLION (JPY). Also, a five for one stock split will happen on September 30 2021.\n\nNext the future projections, consolidated 113% of 2020, Toyota/Lexus 105.6% of 2020, and expected 2.8 Million electrified cars 129% of 2020 (29.2% of vehicles sold will be electrified). Again, a breakdown of predicted expenses with an overall prediction an operating income increase 365 Billion (with a B, in JPY)!!\n\nNext, they took questions. First question wanted more detail on predicted finances which they answered, then a very detailed discussion of the plan:\n\n>\u201cBy 2050, we are to realize carbon-neutral. That is our target. The new vehicle CO2 is not the point. Transport use -- this overall cycle of CO2 use will have to be made neutral. That will be the point. So at this point, rather than restricting or limiting the types of technologies to be used, in order to realize carbon neutrality, various options or various technologies will have to be addressed. We think that will be the most important point and that is where Toyota is putting its entire efforts in. More specifically, we at Toyota has HEV, PHEV, battery EVs or BEVs or FCEVs\u201d\n\nFrom later in the call, but I wanted to move it here since it explains how they define the term:\n\n>\u201cWhat does carbon neutrality actually mean for the automotive industry? Carbon neutrality for the automotive industry means achieving zero CO2 emissions in all processes throughout the lifecycle of manufacturing, transporting, operating, fueling and/or charging, and recycling and disposing of vehicles.\u201d\n\nThen they discuss very specific breakdown of anticipated sales of electrified vehicles by region by 2030 and:\n\n>\u201cAnd globally, this will add up to 8 million electrified vehicles, including hybrids, out of which battery EVs and FCEVs in total would account for about 2 million units. That is our plan. Of course, ultimately, the choice is up to the customer. But at this moment, this is what we are forecasting.\u201d\n\nFollowed by a detailed discussion about the scope of the challenge for future battery production and:\n\n>\u201cat the moment, Toyota's supplied power is 6 gigawatts hours. And in order to realize these numbers, 180 gigawatt hours is necessary; in other words, 30 times the current number. So if you translate that into EV production lines, currently, we have two lines, but that will have to be more than 60 lines, that is more than 30 times. So we will make aggressive investments so that we can realize that. And in addition to that, for battery development or basic units will be reduced, and we will work with alliance partners for procurement so that we can procure the necessary goods. And in addition to that, for battery EV development, compared to the current situation, 15% to 30% reduction in development lead time is to be aimed at. \u201c\n\nAnd\n\n>\u201cSo for the investments, electrification case, digitalization, roughly speaking, on an annual basis, we are currently making an investment of JPY 1 trillion. This year, compared to the past levels, we intend to increase investment by 20%\u201d\n\nDid you notice that number, Trillion! I ran out of fingers and toes to count how many zeros that was.\n\nNext the BIG question: \u201c**how do you see the supply demand forecast for semiconductors**?\u201d\n\nWell:\n\n>\u201cThe supply demand situation still can fluctuate and we cannot sit back and relax yet, but we are not forecasting a major impact by semiconductors\u201d\n\nCompare that to **their competitor**, the largest automobile manufacturer (**by market cap**) most recent earnings call:\n\n>\u201cyes. This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.  \n>  \n>This is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nAm I just cherry picking, trying to sensationalize something for clicks? Well, here is **what Ford had to say** in their earnings call:\n\n>\u201cThe semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team, as our underlying strength at Ford improves\u201d\n\nThen another important question \u201cyou also showed the outlook for carbon neutral for 2030, and you talked about 6 million, and your plan was to increase carbon-neutral vehicles and PHEV. And could you share with us the reason why you believe customers will be choosing those vehicles?\u201d\n\nRemember the customer! Here\u2019s part of their answer:\n\n>\u201cAnd for 2030, for one thing, as Mr. Kamisawa mentioned in his own question, the battery EV, its prices and availability of infrastructure on the global situation is not likely to progress significantly. That's one assessment. And with respect to hybrid EV and plug-in hybrid EV, those are easier for customers to choose and use.  \n>  \n>But I would like to add further to that question about the Japanese data. We are focused on connectivity or connected. And through connected network, we obtain information and data on vehicles. And even in the case of hybrid EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, especially in urban areas, the distance traveled by electric mode is quite long. And probably, we can share with you later on, but in the urban areas, generally speaking, there is some difference between urban area and suburban areas, but in urban areas, even in the case of hybrid electric vehicles, about 50% of the times, it is running on the electric mode.  \n>  \n>And in the case of PHEV, of course, there are differences in conditions, but 70% or 80% of the times, it is driven on pure electric mode. So hybrid EVs or plug in hybrid EVs, not just their performance and also the data that we can obtain through connectivity, and also, we use information we obtain from navigations. And using that, depending upon where the vehicle is located, the EV mode ratio can be increased or decreased, so adjusted. And those can be doable in the future through hybrid vehicles as well as plug-in EVs. So we would like to make contribution to the environment in a sustainable manner as well as practical manner.\u201d\n\nSo the first hour of the two hour call was intended to be focused on the financials and the second half on the future (more long term plans) for electrification, batteries, data and Woven City. The questioners wanted to focus on all that stuff right away, so they answered the questions.", "Inspirations from India ~ The Industrial & Jewellery Demand from The Nr.1 Silver Importer of The World (Part 2 of 2) **NB: These posts are best viewed on PC/Mac, or in** ***Desktop View*** **browser mode** (if on mobile).\n\nLast fortnight, FREESPEECHSTICKERS asked about the *landscape of India's* ***industrial*** *silver demand,* so I ventured upon making an exposition showing and linking to a variety of articles and sources (of which many are Indian, in English language) while making a few charts.\n\nBold text in all abstracts is **highlighted text** (except titles)**,** and text in \\[brackets marked with --Ed.\\] are comments.

Silver's unsurpassed thermal and electrical conductivity among metals means it cannot easily be replaced by less expensive materials.  \n>  \n>For example, small quantities of silver are used as **contacts in electrical switches:** join the contacts, and the switch is on; separate them and the switch is off. Whether turning on a bedroom light using a conventional switch or turning on a microwave using a **membrane switch,** the result is the same: the current can pass through only when the  contacts are joined. **Automobiles** are full of contacts that control  electronic features, and so are consumer appliances. **Industrial strength switches** use silver, too.  \n>  \n>How does silver get from the earth to these electronic devices? Silver comes from silver mines or from lead and zinc mines from which  silver is a by-product. Smelting and refining removes silver from the ore. Then, the silver is usually shaped into bars or grains.\u00a0Electronics demand silver of the highest purity: 99.99% pure, also known  as having a fineness of 999.9.  \n>  \n>Dissolving pure silver in nitric acid produces silver nitrate, which can be formed into powder or flakes. This material, in turn, can be fabricated into contacts or silver pastes, like conductive paste made with a silver-palladium alloy.  \n>  \n>**Silver paste** has many uses, such as the membrane switch already  mentioned and the **rear defrost in many cars.** In electronics, **circuit  paths,** as well as passive components called **multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs),** rely on silver paste.

One example of a printed electronic is the **electrode in a supercapacitor,** which can charge and discharge repeatedly  and quickly. **Regenerative breaking** is an automotive innovation that  allows the **kinetic energy of a slowing vehicle to be stored in a supercapacitor for reuse.** **Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags** offer another powerful application of printed electronics.

At this point many still used cattle for barter in India, but over time they gradually found precious metals to be much easier to trade fairly with).

Critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, and cobalt, are indispensable components in technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. With the global demand for these minerals projected to surge by 400-600 percent in the coming decades, ensuring a secure and resilient supply chain has never been more vital. However, with China dominating the market for processing and refining these critical minerals, the tenuous nature of our current supply chains could pose a significant risk to our clean energy future. \n\nCritical minerals are mined in various locations worldwide, with lithium, for instance, being extracted from sources such as brine in South America and hard rock in Australia. While each mining method comes with its environmental challenges, it is the processing of these minerals into usable compounds that exposes the inherent vulnerabilities in our supply chains. Most lithium processing facilities are situated in China, which accounted for over 60% of the world\u2019s lithium production in 2019. As a result, the global trade of lithium batteries and other essential products is heavily reliant on the existing supply chains.\n\nConsidering these challenges, securing the critical mineral supply chain has become a pressing concern for countries across the globe. By investing in the exploration, extraction, processing, and recycling of these valuable resources, nations can reduce their dependence on foreign sources and foster sustainable growth in their clean energy sectors. Additionally, establishing partnerships with Indigenous communities and adhering to the highest environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards will be crucial in developing a responsible and resilient critical minerals value chain. The green energy revolution is upon us, and the time to act on securing our critical mineral supply chains is now.\n\n# Strategies\n\nCountries worldwide, including Canada and the United States, are taking significant steps to secure their critical mineral supplies to bolster the transition to green energy. In Canada, the Critical Minerals Centre of Excellence (CMCE) is leading the development and coordination of policies and programs in collaboration with various stakeholders. Six focus areas have been identified: driving research, innovation, and exploration; accelerating project development; building sustainable infrastructure; advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples; growing a diverse workforce and prosperous communities; and strengthening global leadership and security.\n\nTo support these focus areas, Canada\u2019s federal government has committed substantial funding to various aspects of the critical minerals value chain. Budget commitments from 2021 and 2022 include $79.2 million for public geoscience and exploration to better identify and assess mineral deposits, a 30% Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for targeted critical minerals, $47.7 million for targeted upstream critical mineral R&D through Canada\u2019s research labs, and $144.4 million for critical mineral research and development, and the deployment of technologies and materials to support critical mineral development for upstream and midstream segments of the value chain.\n\nIn the United States, President Biden signed Executive Order 14017 to review vulnerabilities in the critical mineral and material supply chains. The resulting first-of-its-kind supply chain assessment highlighted the national and economic security threats posed by over-reliance on foreign sources. Consequently, the administration is working to expand domestic mining, production, processing, and recycling of critical minerals and materials in collaboration with partners and allies, while adhering to strong labor, environmental, and community engagement standards.\n\nMajor investments in domestic production of key critical minerals and materials have been announced, including a $35 million award from the Department of Defense\u2019s Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program to MP Materials for processing heavy rare earth elements in California. This investment will help establish a full end-to-end domestic permanent magnet supply chain. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables will break ground on a new demonstration facility in California to test the commercial viability of sustainable lithium extraction from geothermal brine.\n\nFurthermore, Redwood Materials is partnering with Ford and Volvo to pilot the collection and recycling of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries at its Nevada-based facilities, extracting lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. The Department of Energy is also investing $140 million in a demonstration project to recover rare earth elements and critical minerals from coal ash and other mine waste, reducing the need for new mining and creating job opportunities in legacy coal communities. With these significant initiatives and investments, both Canada and the United States are working towards securing their critical mineral supply chains for a sustainable green energy future.\n\n# Market forecasts\n\nThis green energy future is only going to increase demand for critical minerals. For instance, the [uranium market](https://equity.guru/2023/04/14/kazatomprom-boosts-uranium-production-to-fulfill-orders-for-new-customers/) is expected to grow substantially over the next two decades, with a 27% increase in demand predicted for 2021-2030 and a 38% increase for 2031-2040, according to the World Nuclear Association\u2019s Nuclear Fuel Report. This growth in demand is driven by increased reactor capacity and growing electricity demand.\n\nThe niobium market, valued at $1544.7 million in 2021, is also projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.61% to reach $1979.63 million by 2028, according to a report by Extrapolate. Niobium\u2019s unique properties make it essential in various industries and applications, including renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\nThe global market for lithium, valued at $7.49 billion in 2022, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is primarily driven by the electrification of vehicles, as lithium-ion batteries are increasingly used in electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nMeanwhile, the global metal magnesium market, valued at $4.39 billion in 2021, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2022 to 2030. The market growth is driven by the increasing demand for lightweight components in the automotive and aerospace sectors.\n\n# The players\n\nThese government initiatives and exploding demand have created an opportunity for domestic critical mineral explorers like Standard Uranium, Skyharbour Resources, NioCorp Developments, Azincourt Energy, Beyond Minerals, and West High Yield Resources.\n\nCanadian junior uranium exploration company [**Standard Uranium (STND.V)**](https://standarduranium.ca/), is sniffing out uranium discoveries in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan.

What are you waiting for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# April 19, 2023~ (Opinion Article) ~A Week of Circularity: All Minerals Considered~ by Alyssia Falsarone\n\n**(Sharing An Interesting View & Opinion....)**\n\n [A Week of Circularity: All Minerals Considered \u2013 investESG.eu](https://investesg.eu/2023/04/19/a-week-of-circularity-all-minerals-considered/) \n\n  \n\n# Circularity Roadmaps Explained\n\nWhen it comes to roadmaps addressing opportunities to enhance the circularity of critical minerals, it\u2019s important to notice that they are usually written as bilateral trade agreements, with the export dependence of a country vs. another at their core. They also tend to address only aspects of the circular economy mostly associated with the responsible use and sourcing of minerals, leaving the reduction of demand for primary minerals aside.\n\nThe recent perspective of the\u00a0Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO)\u00a0on CM opportunities in Australia is one example of that. Released earlier this year, it follows the Netherlands\u2019\u00a0[National Raw Materials Strategy\u00a0](https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/detail?id=2022D53210&did=2022D53210)and prioritizes securing critical raw material supply chains in Australia as a valuable partner for the clean energy transition \u201c[*due to its critical mineral deposits and marked improvement in ESG practices\u201d*](https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2023-03/Critical%20Minerals%20Opportunities%20in%20Australia%202023.pdf).\n\nOn the other end, Australia holds deposits for a majority of the CM identifies by the IEA (no.1 global position for lithium and no.2 for cobalt), and it\u2019s focused on developing a solid minerals mining and processing industry, seeking collaboration with international partners through off-take agreements and supply contracts. The Critical Minerals Strategy released by the Australian Government in 2022, places a strong effort on building government-to-government and industry-to-industry links with key international players. Not a surprise when we think of how spread out the CM value chain is:\n\n1. The Netherlands imports (semi)-finished goods (downstream)\n2. Australia focuses on exploration and mining\n3. Malaysia and the US handle refining and processing\\*\n\n\\*Yes, China dominates the critical mineral refining industry.\n\nWhere does the circular economy come into play in the current quest for securing CM supply chains and adopting the lens of bilateral trade agreements on a developing scenario for mining and processing capabilities?\n\nAnd more importantly, can we increase the supply of the CMs that have been identified as key to the transition to a low carbon economy without having to dig new mines?\n\n[ The Circular Economy and Critical Minerals for the Green Transition\u201d report \\(2022\\) by the WWF and Sintef ](https://preview.redd.it/4e7gqesbjuua1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89fc43eb2a1307bc7c6a95b517c39601237d660)\n\n# Investing in the Circular Economy\n\nInvestments from foreign companies and governments are deemed essential in mineral-rich countries such as Australia to achieve the planned scale-up of supply chains such as EV batteries. Mining companies are looking specifically for co-investments to avoid bearing the majority of the risk before the start of the project through off-take agreements and supply contracts.\n\nAn example of co-investment is Tesla, who stated in 2021 that it would deploy $1 billion AUD a year on battery raw materials from Australia. One of the attractions in Australia, besides its mineral deposits, is its expertise in mining. Ford and Toyota are also co-investing in critical mineral processing in the region.\n\n*Caveat on Technology Innovation:*\u00a0the development of low-carbon technologies with low or no critical minerals is still in its early stages. Governments are providing research grants to boost this development and ensure the success of the new technologies to reduce the demand for critical minerals. Many more are needed.\n\n***How can private sector investors address due diligence of responsible mining and sourcing of CMs while also advancing their circularity?***\n\nCarlota Esguevillas\u00a0and the team at\u00a0EdenTree Investment Management\u00a0have provided an example in the review of their investment in\u00a0Imerys, a French integrated mineral solutions company rather than a pure-play mining company, operating over 100 deposits worldwide and mine over 30 different minerals used by industries such as electric batteries, construction, and food production.\n\nThe site visit of the company\u2019s largest China Clay (Kaolin) mine in Cornwall\u00a0provided an opportunity to test the company\u2019s efforts with the by-products of the mining operations (a large part of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium was built with by-products from the mine that Carlota visited), and the closed-loop recovery of minerals.\n\nThere is also an increasing number of\u00a0[use cases\u00a0](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-022-00315-5)where the ability of companies to add circularity strategies to their existing operations is more economical than creating an entire new process from scratch.\u00a0Alessandra Hool\u00a0from the\u00a0ESM Foundation\u00a0discusses it as part of the proceedings of the International Round Table on Materials Criticality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# See Reports Below:\n\n \n\n# ~ 2022 ~The Future is Circular - Circular Economy and Critical Minerals for the Green Transition~\n\n [CircularEconomyAndCriticalMineralsReport.pdf (unit.no)](https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/3032049/CircularEconomyAndCriticalMineralsReport.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szsa45t4kuua1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dd7485c0f0dc3991814e4a2e834c1a8d9181694\n\n#  Conclusion \n\nConcerns have been raised over whether we will be able to provide the minerals required for the low\u0002carbon technologies needed for the green shift. By examining how different technology pathways could  change critical minerals requirements, and how different strategies for circular economy can further  reduce the minerals demand, this report shows that there is not one solution to the question of mineral  availability. Instead, a successful transition will maximise emission reductions while simultaneously  minimising the impacts of mining expansion on communities and the environment. The current resource extraction and consumption system relies on the paradigm of a linear economy, a  structure of \"take, make and waste\" which is reflected on the extraction of high-quality resources from  the natural environment, converted into products with limited lifetime, and then disposed back to the  environment as waste, with minimal recovery. In the current system, the option between extraction of  virgin resources from nature and the recirculation of materials already in society is viewed as a purely  economic decision, with little concerns regarding externalities and how these decisions affect people and  ecosystems on the other side of the planet.  This report approached the issue of availability of seven critical minerals for the green transition: lithium,  cobalt, nickel, manganese, rare earth elements, platinum and copper. These are among the most  discussed in studies on mineral bottleneck for new energy technologies and for which demand is  expected to grow many-fold. New mining sources, including from deep-sea mining, are being discussed by industries and policy-makers as a solution to the mineral bottleneck for the green transition. However,  a green transition must promote not just the technological solutions, but strategies to promote responsible  use and sourcing of minerals. Whether critical minerals will pose a challenge to a low-carbon future depends on which path is taken.  This report approached this issue from three fronts. First, how technological development and different  technological choices can alleviate material demand. Second, how different circular economy strategies  can contribute to reduce mineral demand. And third, how improving collection and recycling can replace  a significant volume of mineral extraction in the medium and long term.  The role of technological innovation in reducing mineral demand Technological choices will have a major influence on the demand for minerals. In this report, a scenario  with high technological innovation and substitution will reduce the total demand for these minerals by  30% between 2022 and 2050. This includes the early adoption and upscaling of new technologies with  lower demand for critical minerals that are either available or under development. The use of different  chemistries for electric vehicle batteries and moving away from lithium-ion batteries for grid  applications could greatly reduce the total demand for cobalt, nickel, and manganese by half. Similarly,  increasing the use of electric traction motors and wind turbine generators with low or no content of  permanent magnets with rare earth minerals could cut the total demand of rare earth elements by one  third. These technologies are not a futuristic dream. Manufacturers of wind turbines and electric vehicles  are investing in reducing the critical mineral content of their products, and an increasing number of  research and innovation grants are being distributed for developing and upscaling prototypes of low\u0002carbon technologies with lower reliance on these mineral \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# JUNE 2022 ~ GLOBAL INVESTORS for SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ~ ICGN - GISD Model Mandate ~ ESG~\n\n#  [ICGN GISD Model Mandate 2022.pdf](https://www.icgn.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/ICGN%20GISD%20Model%20Mandate%202022.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1s9acrlhguua1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2722f01ab37c1f0b2d2c3f04486d50d5d4b63049\n\n#  WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT INVESTING? \n\nThere are different definitions of Sustainable Development  Investing (SDI).

In the past decade, significant advances have been achieved for commercializing the technology. For example, several PEM fuel cell buses are currently rated at the technical readiness stage of full-scale validation in realistic driving environments and have met or closely met the ultimate 25,000-h target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. So far, Toyota has sold more than 4000 Mirai PEM fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Over 30 hydrogen gas stations are being operated throughout the U.S. and over 60 in Germany. In this review, we cover the material, design, fundamental, and manufacturing aspects of PEM fuel cells with a focus on the portable, automobile, airplane, and space applications that require careful consideration in system design and materials. The technological status and challenges faced by PEM fuel cells toward their commercialization in these applications are described and explained. Fundamental issues that are key to fuel cell design, operational control, and material development, such as water and thermal management, dynamic operation, cold start, channel two-phase flow, and low-humidity operation, are discussed. Fuels and fuel tanks pertinent to PEM fuel cells are briefly evaluated. The objective of this review is three fold: (1) to present the latest status of PEM fuel cell technology development and applications in the portable and transportation power through an overview of the state of the art and most recent technological advances; (2) to describe materials and water/thermal transport management for fuel cell design and operational control; and (3) to outline major challenges in the technology development and the needs for fundamental research for the near future and prior to fuel cell world-wide deployment\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehrtdeqramua1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=9974b1a2146fb64795bd24af571a3d1ae64ff9d1\n\n# 2020 ~ The role of Niobium in the hydrogen economy\n\n[The role of Niobium in the hydrogen economy](https://niobium.tech/en/pages/content-pages/the-role-of-niobium-in-the-hydrogen-economy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/42imnanybmua1.png?width=1775&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c8c71690883a6863038319f8ec7f9bd67ad8d53\n\n# 2023~Effect of niobium on the performance of Pd-TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production~\n\n[Effect of niobium on the performance of Pd-TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production | Elsevier Enhanced Reader](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0920586123001712?token=77501E7E449006B1C95186581421A884E77BA6EEC6834C2D42FDCFA9294CB2A2E4DCB2B2DC08D00700207B9A8326C875&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20230418101850)\n\n# \n\n# U.S. Dept. of Energy HYDROGEN PROGRAM & FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:\n\n# [U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen Program : DOE Hydrogen Program](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen Program, led by the [Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-office)\u00a0(HFTO) within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), conducts research and development in hydrogen production, delivery, infrastructure, storage, fuel cells, and multiple end uses across transportation, industrial, and stationary power applications. The program also includes activities in technology validation, manufacturing, analysis, systems development and integration, safety, codes and standards, education, and workforce development\n\n# Hydrogen Production\n\nThe DOE Hydrogen Program activities for hydrogen production are focused on early-stage research advancing efficient and cost-effective production of hydrogen from diverse domestic sources, including renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy resources. Hydrogen production is a critical component of the [H2@Scale](https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/h2-scale) initiative, which explores the potential for integration of hydrogen into our energy and industrial infrastructure.\n\nHydrogen can be produced from diverse domestic feedstocks using a variety of process technologies. Hydrogen-containing compounds such as fossil fuels, biomass, or even water can be a source of hydrogen. Thermochemical processes are used to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal or from renewable sources such as biomass. Electricity generated from sunlight, wind, and nuclear sources can be used to electrolytically produce hydrogen from water. Sunlight by itself can also be used to directly produce hydrogen from water using advanced photoelectrochemical, thermochemical, and photobiological processes.\n\n## Hydrogen from Natural Gas\n\nThe [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy](https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production) (EERE) and the [Office of Fossil Energy](https://energy.gov/fe/office-fossil-energy) (FE) are working to reduce the cost of producing hydrogen via steam methane reforming. EERE is focused on innovative technologies for distributed hydrogen production from natural gas and bio-derived feedstocks. FE is focused on sub-centralized and centralized hydrogen production and on investigating carbon sequestration technologies for capture and utilization of carbon dioxide emissions. Although hydrogen from natural gas is commercially viable today, it is viewed by DOE as a bridge technology to enable future energy scenarios where hydrogen is sustainably produced using all the diverse domestic resources.\n\n## Hydrogen from Coal\n\nResearch sponsored by the [Office of Fossil Energy](https://energy.gov/fe/office-fossil-energy) is focused on advancing the technologies needed to produce hydrogen from coal-derived synthesis gas and to build and operate a zero emissions, high-efficiency co-production power plant that will produce hydrogen from coal along with electricity. FE is also investigating carbon sequestration technologies to address carbon dioxide capture and utilization from coal-based processes.\n\n## Hydrogen from Nuclear Power\n\nResearch sponsored by the [Office of Nuclear Energy](https://energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy) (NE) is focused on developing the industrial-scale production of hydrogen using the heat and electricity from nuclear energy systems. Key research areas include high-temperature thermochemical cycles, high-temperature electrolysis, and reactor/process interface issues. Hybrid nuclear-renewable energy systems for providing clean, secure, and abundant domestic power are also under investigation.\n\n## Hydrogen from Renewable Resources\n\nEarly-stage research sponsored by [EERE](https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production/) is focused on developing advanced technologies for producing hydrogen from domestic renewable energy resources with minimal environmental impacts. Ongoing research areas include electrolysis at low and high temperatures, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, thermochemical conversion of biomass, as well as microbial-based conversion of biomass and waste streams.\n\nThe [Energy Materials Network](https://energy.gov/eere/energy-materials-network/) advanced water splitting materials consortium, [HydroGEN](https://www.h2awsm.org/), is specifically focused on accelerating research and development of advanced water splitting technologies for clean and sustainable hydrogen production from domestic renewable energy resources. HydroGEN facilitates collaborative research, offering industry and academic researchers streamlined access to the world-class facilities at DOE's national laboratories. The consortium offers more than 80 unique capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment and expertise relevant to the advanced water-splitting technologies of low- and high-temperature electrolysis as well as photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting.\n\n## Basic Research\n\nThe [Office of Science's Office of Basic Energy Sciences](https://science.energy.gov/bes/) focuses on fundamental research of matter and energy, offering scientific insights that can facilitate the advancement of hydrogen production technologies. As an example, research to develop a fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions is being applied to photo-induced water-splitting systems that use the energy of sunlight to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen by semiconductors or photocatalytic assemblies. Fundamental research in catalysis, membranes, and gas separation is also being used to enable more efficient, lower-cost fossil-based hydrogen production.\n\n# MARCH 30, 2023 ~DOE Hydrogen Program 2023 AMR Early Bird Registration Closing April 10!~\n\n[DOE Hydrogen Program 2023 AMR Early Bird Registration Closing April 10 | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/doe-hydrogen-program-2023-amr-early-bird-registration-closing-april-10)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gq2klgltgmua1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=954b7486dda753be42b8ebf2954a3b305e3fd5ad\n\n# A SMALL HINT AT THE INDUSTRY SUPPORTING THE PUSH TO GREEN HYDROGEN\n\n# APRIL 7, 2023~President Biden Visits Future Electrolyzer Manufacturing Facility on Investing in America Tour~\n\n[President Biden Visits Future Electrolyzer Manufacturing Facility on Investing in America Tour | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/president-biden-visits-future-electrolyzer-manufacturing-facility-investing)\n\n[ Cummins starting up its first U.S. Hydrogen Electrolyzer Manufacturing site in the U.S. | EnergyTech  ](https://preview.redd.it/jo5feuw9imua1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=874ae03362c254a3ec999f93b7ca0f04b67bd365)\n\nU.S.-based engine and equipment firm Cummins Inc. has made numerous inroads into hydrogen investment and development in North America, and now the company is taking a huge stake in the domestic H2 supply chain within its home country.\n\nCummins announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the U.S. Its first electrolyzer manufacturing site in the U.S. will be in Fridley, Minnesota, where the company already has a generator production plant (seen above).\n\nNearly 90,000 square feet of the Fridley plant will be dedicated to the H2 electrolyzers.

The Cummins PEM brands are the HyLZYER 500 and HyLYZER 5000. They can produce so-called \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d if the electrolyzers used by generation firms are powered by carbon-free energy resources such as wind, solar, nuclear or hydro.\n\n\u201cExpanding Cummins\u2019 electrolyzer manufacturing footprint to the United States is a milestone not only for our company but an important step in advancing global decarbonization efforts,\u201d said Alexey Ustinov, Vice President of Electrolyzers at Cummins, in a statement. \u201cThis is a reflection of increasing government support through the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.energytech.com/resources/webinars/webinar/21250036/now-is-the-moment-new-government-support-for-climate-projects), Hydrogen Hubs and a blossoming hydrogen economy in the states.

States and businesses are making final pitches Friday as they compete for a new program that will create regional networks, or \u201chubs,\u201d of hydrogen producers, consumers and infrastructure. The aim is to accelerate the availability and use of the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some vehicles and trains.\n\nHow can enough hydrogen be produced to meet demand \u2014 in ways that don\u2019t worsen global warming? And how can it be moved efficiently to where users can get it? Such questions will be tackled by the hubs.\n\nNearly every state has joined at least one proposed hub and many are working together, hoping to reap the economic development and jobs they would bring. The governors of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma came up with the \u201cHALO Hydrogen Hub\u201d to compete for funding, for example.\n\nBig fossil fuel companies like Chevron and EQT Corporation, renewable energy developers such as Obsidian, and researchers in university and government labs are involved, too.\n\nBut only a select few will receive billions in federal funding. Here are some questions and answers about the initiative:\n\n# Q. What is a hydrogen hub?\n\nA. The bipartisan infrastructure law signed by President [Joe Biden](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/JoeBiden) last year included $8 billion for a program to establish six to 10 regional \u201chydrogen hubs\u201d around the nation. A hub is meant to be a network of companies that produce clean hydrogen and of the industries that use it \u2014 heavy [transportation](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/TSA), for example \u2014 and infrastructure such as pipelines and refueling stations. States and companies have teamed up to create hub proposals. Their final applications are due Friday at the U.S. Department of Energy, which is expected to start awarding money later this year.\n\n# Q. Why hydrogen?\n\nHydrogen can be made in ways that yield little if any planet-warming greenhouse gases. The Energy Department says hydrogen, once produced, can generate power in a fuel cell, emitting only water vapor and warm air. The department says the hubs will produce \u201cclean\u201d hydrogen, although its definition includes hydrogen produced with natural gas. Gas companies have talked about mixing hydrogen at low concentrations with methane for delivery to homes and businesses.\n\nSome consider hydrogen \u201cclean\u201d only if made through electrolysis \u2014 splitting water molecules using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which also is carbon free, as well as nuclear power. But some oil and gas companies say they can use fossil fuels as feedstocks if they capture the carbon dioxide and keep it out of the atmosphere.\n\nEnvironmental groups say hydrogen presents its own pollution and climate risks. When emitted into the atmosphere, it boosts volumes of methane and other greenhouse gases, underscoring the need to avoid leaks from hydrogen systems \u2013 an issue the hubs should consider, said Nichole Saunders, staff attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\n# Q. Who are the finalists?\n\nThe Energy Department asked for detailed plans and received 79. In December, the department encouraged 33 of those with hub proposals to submit a final application, although ones that were discouraged can still apply. The department hasn\u2019t identified the applicants because of sensitive negotiations over where to put the hubs.\n\nThe [environment](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Environment)al nonprofit Clean Air Task Force has monitored the process and identified 23 finalists on an online map. The Associated Press contacted those groups and received responses from most, confirming that they were encouraged by the DOE to apply by Friday and sharing details of their plans. Among them are energy producers \u2014 fossil fuels as well as renewable developers \u2014 plus states, universities, national laboratories, utilities and companies that plan to use the hydrogen.\n\nMore than 60 public and private entities in the Midwest want a hub in their region, for example. The Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen says it would be an \u201cideal fit,\u201d partly because many large industrial sectors there, including steel, ammonia and refining, rely on \u201cdirty hydrogen consumption\u201d to fuel their operations.\n\n# Q. What are they proposing?\n\nA. At least eight plan to source their hydrogen from fossil fuels and produce it using natural gas, in keeping with a provision in the law that at least two hubs should be in areas with the nation's most abundant gas supplies.\n\nThe Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub is a partnership involving the state of West Virginia and EQT, the nation's largest natural gas producer, among others. They say their region has enormous gas resources and could produce hydrogen from methane using heat, steam and pressure while capturing the carbon dioxide it would generate.\n\nAt least eight other proposals would generate hydrogen from water through electrolysis, primarily using renewable sources such as wind and solar, although some would power the process with nuclear energy. They are concentrated in coastal and Upper Midwestern states. The Northeast Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub proposal includes seven Northeast states, led by New York, and more than 100 partners who would use hydrogen in transportation and heavy industries, and for long-duration energy storage.\n\nCalifornia has a renewables-only plan to use hydrogen to decarbonize transportation, ports and power plants, with its Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems. Washington and Oregon also want to use renewables to produce hydrogen to use for heavy-duty transportation, aviation, maritime and agriculture. The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association says it\u2019s planning projects in those two states, plus Montana.\n\nThe Great Lakes Clean Hydrogen Coalition would produce hydrogen at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Oak Harbor, Ohio, through electrolysis and transport it by pipeline and truck for the region\u2019s steelmaking, aviation and glass manufacturing industries.\n\nSome hubs would use both natural gas with carbon capture techniques and renewables, like the HyVelocity proposal in the Gulf region. That hub includes Chevron, Air Liquide, University of Texas, GTI Energy and the Center for Houston\u2019s Future. They say a hub makes sense there because the Texas Gulf Coast already produces 3.5 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, or one-third of all U.S. hydrogen production.\n\n# Q. Why is this important?\n\nThe United States can't meet its climate goals relying on a vast buildout of renewables and electrification alone, said Emily Kent, the U.S. director for zero-carbon fuels at the Clean Air Task Force.\n\nBut clean hydrogen plays an important role in decarbonizing sectors of the economy that are nearly impossible to electrify, she added. That includes long-haul trucking, marine shipping and aviation, heavy industries including iron and steelmaking, and the existing production and use of hydrogen.\n\nYet, the United States makes very little hydrogen. Currently it's produced using natural gas to be used for refining petroleum and producing ammonia for fertilizer.\n\nJoseph Majkut, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the hubs, along with the tax credits offered for hydrogen production, are the way the U.S. is going to commit significant public spending to jumpstart the industry.\n\nThe country wants to make the electric grid carbon-free by 2035, and reach net zero economy-wide by 2050 so the greenhouse gases produced are no more than the amount removed from the atmosphere. The U.S. Department of Energy says hydrogen has great potential for providing power and heat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been producing and using hydrogen for a long time,\" Kent said. \"We have not been producing it in these ways, with these technologies, and we have not been using it in a lot of these sectors.\u201d\n\n# Niocorp will mine, process & produce Niobium, Scandium & Titanium at site in Nebraska once financed & constructed.  ~GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES~  \"MAY\" Indeed Benefit from the Critical Minerals Niocorp's ELK CREEK Mine will Produce.\n\n# [https://www.niocorp.com/](https://www.niocorp.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5eaqkfolmua1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=19441fdb8cff9d302067e7121454dfa221411574\n\n# Sharing Responses from Jim Sims to three relevant questions on 3/13/2023\n\n*\\*\\*Jim-\\*\\*A) Could you offer comment on What Scope 3 emissions mean for the Elk Creek mine moving forward into production & to the end users utilizing the products being processed at the mine? & Would Niocorp's Scope 3 Carbon Emission Reductions qualify for/as \"Carbon Credits\" in the context above?

So many retail investors and traders have lost so much money as the result of panic-selling shares for huge losses or forced selling due to margin calls. Probably the biggest toll isn't the financial losses, but the nonstop anxiety about the future, the feeling that the walls are closing in and that there's no way out, and the sense of shock that despite being a smart person, one has somehow completely failed.   There are these 22-year-old TSLA multi-millionaires, while you're a 40-year-old with a mortgage and a net worth rocketing toward $0 faster than a heat-seeking missile. \"How did this happen to *me*!?\" You think about it when you go to bed. You try to distract yourself, but it hijacks your emotions like an evil demon that poisons everything and won't let go until it tears you apart.

I hope that by writing, I can help some people in the future and prevent this from happening to them. I also hope that I can help to show others where to look and what to read to become better educated about the money game. Most of all, I hope that everyone who has been affected by the POWcycles will hang on and not give up.   Most of this nightmare was caused by the virus and our government's desperate attempts to prevent mass bankruptcies of both businesses and individuals. The results were ultimately terrible, and we're suffering because of them, but they could have been even worse if the government hadn't done anything. The only thing that we can do now is to learn from what happened and figure out the best way forward.  Right now, I think the best thing to do in the stock or options market is nothing. Just wait. Eventually, we're going to defeat this virus. The war against Ukraine is somehow going to end. Europe will free itself of its dependence on Russia as its gas station. The supply chain will improve. The stress that we've all been living under for 2.25 years will let up. The stock market's nosedive will stop. And then, that nose will pull *up*!  When it does, we're going to be ready. And as soon as it does, we're going to start making and compounding money again a lot faster than anyone can imagine now.  Hang in there. We're all in this together.

He can't just sell $44 Billion of Tesla stock. If he did, he would weaken his position and the stock value would drop. As it is, Tesla TSLA is way overvalued. It is just simple arithmetic. He has just completed Gigafactory 2 and 3, each costing at least $5 Billion. That was done on borrowed money. Eventually, when they are producing enough cars, they will pay themselves off and start producing profit but that looks like several years from now. Gigafactory 1 produced 930,000 cars in 2021. It is likely there is very little profit being made on these early sales. The auto manufacturers have found the profit from sedans is about $2000 each and from trucks, about $5000. The Tesla stock is way overvalued. It has taken 10 years for Gigafactory 1 to almost reach 1 million cars per year. Ford sold 3.9 million cars and trucks in 2021. Ford stock share is $14, Tesla is trying to hold at $900 per share. That is over 60 times the price of a share of Ford. The valuation of a Tesla share is based totally on futures speculation. Now, the supply line problems are going to hit hard later this year. Taking blood from Tesla to feed Twitter that is leaking blood is not a rational strategy.

Selling weekly calls can be VERY profitable. Here's an example using AAPL (not cheap), but it may be the most widely owned stock. AAPL closed at 157.38 Friday. If you own (or buy) 100 shares of AAPL the cost would be $15,738, or $7,869 on 2:1 margin. Then sell 1 May 13th 157.5 call for 3.30 (again, Friday close). That's a 2.1% premium over the underlying (APPL). Multiply 2.1% x 52 and you are up over 100% in 52 wks. Or, another way of calculating this is to multiply the option price of 3.3 x 52 and you get 171.60 on a stock that closed at 157.38. And, AAPL doesn't have high implied volatility so the premiums on the options aren't particularly high.   You can day trade covered calls the way you day trade the underlying stocks, so if you want \"action\" and fast profits you can sell calls on stocks that are going up. The premium deterioration works to your advantage, rather than buying options, where the premium decay works against you.   People assume that covered calls are a passive way to earn a little profit on stocks that you already hold, but if you do some simple calculations you can quickly see that they can be more profitable than any trading \"system\" or \"algo\" that you can come up with. My very best algo (trading system) on AAPL returned about 20% in the past 1 year. Compare that with the covered call strategy that returned over 100% on the same 100 shares of AAPL. Just trying to give everyone here something else to consider.](/r/Daytrading/comments/uk5nvg/how_i_feel_after_getting_ripped_to_shreds_option/i7pmwvg/)\n\nKEYWORD : AAPL DATE : Sat May  7 19:29:48 2022 SUBREDDIT : Daytrading\n\n\n\n[There are no silly questions about stock trading.  If a stock is trending up or stable and you sell an option against it you pocket the premium. I sell weekly options, some prefer monthly options, but the premium decay is fast with weeklys. You can lose money in the short term if the stock (the underlying) goes down. In that case, as you mentioned, you could short the stock and sell a put. Just the reverse of selling covered calls in a stock that is trending up.  The implied volatility is the amount of volatility \"packed\" into the option price. The 6mo to 2yr trend in volatility is the historic volatility. Currently the market is very volatile so the IV is high across the board.  This past week I bought UVXY and sold a call against it just to get the \"feel\" of the movement. The IV is VERY high. The current premium (price of the out of the money option/price of the underlying stock/ETF)  on the 5/13 18 call is 8.9% - for one week!! Do that over and over again for 52 weeks! Of course, the UVXY has some wild swings, but, if you hold it, it is a hedge against a stock market crash, more leveraged than the VXX. Another ETF that has high IV is the SOXL (3x semiconductor ETF). Same with the SOXS (bear 3x semiconductor ETF). The current IV on the SPY is 23% but the SOXL IV is 117%, SOXS is 119%. So, the SOXS is leveraged about 5:1 vs the SPY and so if you want to hedge your portfolio against a stock market crash, you could hold a 20% position in the SOXS or the VXX or about a 15% position in the UVXY.  Back to selling calls against these ETFs - same applies to other stocks as well, but the moves in stocks is harder to predict than the moves in ETFs (single stock risk). So, other than AAPL, I tend to trade the ETFs. The IV of any stock or option is widely available on many websites - I like (https://Barchart.com). The IV is roughly equal to the average percent true range of the the stock/option. The SPY average daily true range is 2.3% averaged over the past quarter (I make this calculation in my software). The average TR in the SOXL is 11.87% and for the UVXY it is 12.36%. So the UVXY moves, on average, up or down about 12% per day! That's why the options are packed with so much premium.  I know that this is a day trading forum, but I am suggesting that a short term trader can get a lot of movement by selling options against stocks or ETFs that you hold, and the premium decay is about the only \"sure thing\" in the stock market. Options decline in price (theta) and so selling them is a sure thing IF you are hedged property. Selling naked options (unhedged) is very dangerous, but, so are most short term day trading techniques, which is why most day traders lose money.  Basically, my comments are not investing advice, but just some ideas for making money that I seldom ever see mentioned here.](/r/Daytrading/comments/uk5nvg/how_i_feel_after_getting_ripped_to_shreds_option/i7qdwxi/)\n\nKEYWORD : AAPL DATE : Sat May  7 22:58:33 2022 SUBREDDIT : Daytrading\n\n\n\n[This is slavery with extra steps.

Surprisingly, many people actually didn't know where those ideas originally came from.  I can't stand to see misinformation still poisoning the discussion so long after it's been put down, so I want to take a shot at setting the record straight, without requiring people to have to dig to find the actual facts buried underneath the misinformation.\n\nThe fact is, even accounting for the battery manufacturing, transportation, and disposal/recycling, hybrids actually do have notably lower lifetime emissions than normal cars.  Most of the idea about the Prius being worse for the environment than normal cars can be traced back to two sources from 2006 and 2007 - virtually all the other sources are just echoes of those two.\n\nThe first was the Daily Mail, who claimed that Prius battery production had left Sudbury a scarred lunar landscape.  That story was [completely retracted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417227/Toyota-factory.html) when it was pointed out to them that the damage both occurred, and was cleaned up, decades before the Prius even existed.  That is also ignoring the fact that the Prius' nickel demand [accounted for just 0.5% of the mine's total output](http://www.thecarconnection.com/tips-article/1010861_prius-versus-hummer-exploding-the-myth), as well as the fact that all cars use nickel in their stainless steel components.  Based on that, it's extremely implausible that an extra 40 or so pounds of nickel for the battery will inflict so much extra environmental damage as to erase all pollution reduction gains from improved efficiency realized over the car and battery's 10+ year lifetime, especially since the vast majority of a car's pollution is incurred in operation (more on that in a bit).\n\nThe second was CNW Marketing, who infamously claimed in its \"Dust to Dust analysis\" that the Prius, over its lifetime, is worse for the environment than a Hummer.  That study [was shot to pieces](http://www.pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hummer_vs_prius3.pdf) for making biased assumptions favouring the Hummer and disfavouring the Prius (379,000 miles/35 years for the H1 Hummer vs 109,000 miles/12 years for the Prius).  The other critical error they made was assuming that the vast majority of a car's pollution is incurred in manufacturing, rather than operations.  That assumption contradicted a huge body of research from the Rocky Mountain Institute, Transport Research Ltd., the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Center for Sustainable Systems of the University of Michigan, MIT, Volkswagen, the Argonne National Laboratory, and more recently the UCLA.  All of those groups collectively indicated the reverse was true (all references except UCLA's available in the previous link; UCLA link available below).\n\nBased on the collective findings of those organizations, even accounting for the allegedly tremendous difficulties of a hybrid car's battery production and the extra electric motor, 90% of all pollution is incurred in driving the car.  The remaining 10% is split over manufacturing, transporting, and disposing of/recycling the car.  As for the exact breakdowns of pollution per phase, the UCLA did a [good paper](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media_IOE/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf) that gives more exact numbers.  The [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/378.PDF)'s aforementioned life cycle analysis is also consistent with that result.\n\nThere are also criticisms that the shipping of the Prius' individual components is what incurs enough pollution to more than cancel out its efficiency gains.  This, I believe, mostly came from [a student op-ed piece from Connecticut State University](http://www.pdegraaf.com/articles/prius.html) (itself a blend of CNW and Daily Mail's misinformation) and [repeated almost word for word by Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmxUsGiGp3w&t=3m35s). That doesn't square with the reality of shipping efficiency being the world's most efficient form of transport.  Ships move goods at an efficiency of around [600 miles per gallon, per ton](http://www.portofmonroe.com/index.php/pom/shipping-advantages), and that's being conservative, as the UCLA paper above stated 1,000 MPGPT as their assumption.  Given that a Prius weighs [3,042 pounds](http://www.toyota.com/prius/features.html#!/weights_capacities/1223/1225/1227/1229), or 1.35 tons, that means you can move a fully built Prius across the Pacific Ocean to the US (~5,500 miles) using just 12 gallons of freighter fuel.  At that scale, the transportation emissions for moving the battery pack's weight around is effectively negligible.\n\nAll this is not to say that there are no valid criticisms of hybrids - the best of them tend to be purpose-built for efficiency and practicality at the expense of the driving experience.  As well, the inferior handling and controversial styling of the Prius in particular are definitely questionable.  That said, criticisms of hybrid cars' relative environmental impact have collectively failed to stand up to scrutiny, based on all available evidence.  At this point, criticizing hybrids for being worse for the environment is just perpetuating old misinformation, which should have died a quick death half a decade ago rather than persisting as long as it has.", "Google Drive eTextbooks release thread (part-21)!+ Accepting requests every day * **If you find your book in the thread below, send the number of the book via** **reddit chat or via** [**telegram**](https://t.me/textbooks4cheap) **.**\n* **Almost all the books are in their latest editions and some of them are available in multiple editions too**\n* **Books (pdf) are delivered through Google-Drive link**\n* **You can also send requests via reddit chat or by** [**telegram**](https://t.me/textbooks4cheap) **.**\n* **Also, upvote the post if you found it useful**\n\nPlease find the list below\n\n  \n\n6287.

Most important, PJM did this looking forward rather than the usual approach, which is to build for the first new renewable energy project, then start building for the second project, and not consider the needs of a third or fourth project.

That\u2019s actually a small amount. The gas industry has predicted that pipeline construction costs would average $25 billion per year for 20 years. (Take note, planning ahead when building big is less costly than making many incremental steps and missing the efficiency and economies of scale.)\n\nWe think that PJM and ISO-NE can help their states by adopting forward-looking regional transmission planning that plans for future generation to help states meet their energy-related goals more efficiently and cost-effectively\nhttps://blog.ucsusa.org/mike-jacobs/what-is-the-supply-chain-for-clean-energy-and-climate-change/\n\nA greener path\nChina is making its Belt and Road Initiative more environmentally friendly.

These practices include a sensitive protocol that tests groups of plants to detect even low levels of infection. They also started a clean nursery accreditation program to help nurseries comply with the NPNMPs.\n\n\u201cThrough extensive testing, we have verified that nurseries that fully comply with the NPBMPs have had no detectable Phytophthora in their stock,\u201d said Swiecki. \u201cAgencies that have helped fund this program and others have been able to use clean nursery stock from accredited nurseries for habitat restoration plantings.\u201d\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933880\n\nBlack carbon aerosols heating Arctic: Large contribution from mid-latitude biomass burning\n\nThe year-to-year spring variation in Arctic black carbon (BC) aerosol abundance is strongly correlated with biomass burning in the mid-latitudes.

When it came to deception regarding volunteerism, there were no observed sex differences, suggesting both sexes are equally upset by deception relating to altruistic tendencies.\n\nUsing a continuous measure, Study 2 revealed that men were most likely to cancel their date when lied to about looks, rather than employment or volunteerism. However, there were no sex differences in the likelihood of cancelling a date due to attractiveness deception. The researchers suggest this could be due to women\u2019s preferences for partner attractiveness being higher in university populations.\nhttps://www.psypost.org/2021/11/women-get-more-upset-when-deceived-about-mens-work-while-men-get-more-upset-when-deceived-about-womens-looks-62081\n\nIt's normal in life to have peaks and valleys, and I think some of the language we've developed around self-actualization is helpful in many regards.

According to the Sleep Foundation, both of these factors \"allow you to catch a quick rest without entering slow-wave sleep and feeling excessively groggy after waking.\"\n\nResearch, including one 2015 study which looked at how naps could improve cognitive flexibility, have found that napping in early to mid-afternoon, while the body clock experiences a natural circadian dip, has the optimum restorative and energising benefits.\n\nThe best nap length is relatively brief at around 10 to 30 minutes. While measuring post-nap effects such as sleepiness, vigour, and cognitive performance, studies have found 10-minute naps to produce the best results, occurring immediately after waking up and lasting for as long as 155 minutes.\n\nIt can therefore be argued that these factors constitute the perfect nap according to science. This is based on the grounds that the purpose of the nap is both to combat tiredness and to re-invigorate the brain.\nhttps://patient.info/news-and-features/do-naps-count-as-getting-good-sleep\n\n3D-printed robot ant colonies work together to solve problems\nhttps://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/3d-printed-ant-robots-work-together-to-solve-problems\n\nCurrently, the team is conducting a 100-day check-out that has them testing satellite systems and subsystems and calibrating instruments.

Research recently published in Stem Cell Reports\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933946\n\nHence the flurry of climate pledges that were made over the past year. They focus on what will be done by the end of the decade, by which time global greenhouse gas emissions must be roughly half what they were in 2010 in order to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. So far, no country is on track to do this, says Niklas H\u00f6hne of NewClimate Institute, a think-tank. Dr H\u00f6hne is part of a consortium of researchers called Climate Action Tracker, which plugs national climate policies and pledges into models in order to give an idea of how they translate into temperatures. The group\u2019s latest results (see chart), published on November 9th, say that if all 2030 decarbonisation plans were to be carried out as advertised but no further efforts were made, there would be a 68% chance that global average temperatures in 2100 would be between 1.9\u00b0C and 3.0\u00b0C warmer than pre-industrial times, with a median estimate of 2.4\u00b0C.\nhttps://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/11/13/are-climate-goals-set-in-2015-dead-or-alive\n\nUp until exposure to 95 decibels of sound, the inner ear fluid level remained normal. However, researchers discovered that after exposure to 100 decibels\u2014which is equivalent to sounds such as a power lawn mower, chain saw or motorcycle\u2014mice developed inner ear fluid buildup within hours. A week after this exposure, the animals were found to have lost auditory nerve cells.\n\nHowever, when researchers applied hypertonic saline, a salt-based solution used to treat nasal congestions in humans, into affected ears one hour after the noise exposure, both the immediate fluid buildup and the long-term nerve damage lessened, implying that the hearing loss could be at least partially prevented.\n\nThese study results have several important implications, according to Oghalai, especially as the loss of nerve cells in the inner ear is known as \"hidden hearing loss\" because hearing tests are unable to detect the damage.\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-loud-noises-fluid-buildup-ear.html\n\nCompared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna\u2019s shot has led to only 10 additional cases of myocarditis per 100,000 inoculations among males age 12 to 29, Burton said.

The Department of the Interior will offer up more than 80 million acres \u2014 an area larger than the state of New Mexico \u2014 of the Gulf of Mexico for drilling. It is bigger than any lease sale conducted under President Donald Trump\u2019s fossil-fuel-friendly administration, and Interior estimates it will lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades.\n\nThe administration argues its hands are tied, following the June decision by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana to strike down Biden\u2019s executive order temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters.\n\n\u201cThe administration has made clear that it disagrees with the ruling and the Department of Justice has appealed it, but the government must comply with it in the meantime,\u201d White House spokesman Vedant Patel said in an email statement, noting that Interior previously canceled the pending lease sale.\n\nThe injunction stemmed from a lawsuit brought by 14 Republican attorneys against the administration. The judge\u2019s opinion relied in part on a study of the leasing pause\u2019s potential economic impacts, which an industry trade group helped shape and that multiple independent researchers dismissed.\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-climate-gulf-oil-lease-sale_n_618eeb77e4b0b1aee9252872\n\nwere prescribed an intermittent fasting schedule: twice a week water-only 24-hour fasting for four weeks, then once a week water-only 24 hour-fasting for 22 weeks. Fasts could not be done on consecutive days.

Batteries can last enough charge - discharge cycles to be useful (and acceptable to the general public). \n1. Having a car with a large battery does not cost more (or much more than an ICE vehicle). \n\nIn the case of EVs, the big assumption for some of the more optimistic adoption rates  remains that battery prices will continue to fall forever. \n\n\nThe other is that if  prices do not fall quick enough that an EV ban is politically viable.  Effectively, this means that people who cannot afford EVs would be banned from being able to purchase a new vehicle.  See here for my thoughts on why this is not politically viable if EV prices do not fall. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/klkdjy/some_thoughts_about_why_you_need_to_be_skeptical/\n\nIn other cases, some nations have not outright banned ICE vehicles, but have allowed hybrids, which causes many BEV enthusiast sites to complain. \n\nhttps://electrek.co/2020/10/27/china-plans-2035-gas-car-ban-that-doesnt-actually-ban-gas-cars/\n\nElectrek and similar websites are assuming that prices for EVs will continue to fall forever.\n\nIs this a realistic assumption? \n\nFor the purposes of this article, I'd like to focus on the US. \n\n#A pessimistic view \n\nThe pessimistic view is based on silicon. Advocates of EVs often use Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling as an example for EVs.  In the  early 2000s, it was imagined that with a big enough push, a 10 GHz CPU would be viable. \n\n\n##The Moore's Law Analogy\nIn 1992, both HP and DEC for example released a 100 MHz CPU, and Intel would release the Pentium CPU that also hit 100 MHz in 1995. By 2004, Intel had released its Prescott Pentium 4 CPU with a clockspeed of 3.8 GHz. Going from 1992 to 2004, that works out to an improvement of 38x in a period of 12 years in clockspeed.   But since then, CPU clockspeeds have hit a physical wall that has dramatically slowed down progress.  Making things worse, so too has the progression in terms  of IPC improvement. Efforts to make more cores have since emerged, but of course it is not a perfect substitute, and workloads are limited by Amdahl's Law.  Chiplets, pioneered by AMD, too are a recent development, but again not a substitute (https://www.extremetech.com/computing/280344-chiplets-are-the-future-but-they-wont-replace-moores-law). \n\nStrictly speaking, Moore's Law refers to the idea that the number of transistors doubles every 24 months, so the cost per transistor is halved. Even here the transition to the latest node (at time of this writing, TSMC has a 5nm node, and TSMC is currently the leading fab in the industry), costs more per gate than the previous 7nm. \n\n- https://semianalysis.com/apples-a14-packs-134-million-transistors-mm2-but-falls-far-short-of-tsmcs-density-claims/\n- https://semianalysis.com/apple-a14-die-annotation-and-analysis-terrifying-implications-for-the-industry/\n\n>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.\n\nSo in effect, Moore's law  as a function of transistors getting cheaper appears to be dead. SRAM doesn't scale very well.\n\nThe challenges the industry has encountered wit h smaller nodes, which have resulted in ever increasing fab sizes are a testament to the challenges that will only get worse as transistors get smaller.  Some technologies, such as 450mm wafers shave been abandoned altogether. \n\n##What about for EVs?\n\nBattery prices have seen a very fantastic fall, but they are not Moore's Law. \n\nMoore's Law is a function of the amount of transistors on a piece of silicon.  In fact, it can be argued that mentioning Moore's Law for EVs and batteries is a sign of ignorance. \n\nhttps://www.greencarreports.com/news/1087071_mentioning-moores-law-for-electric-cars-sign-of-ignorance\n\n>But battery cost reduction does not follow Moore's law, because the fundamental technology of lithium-ion cells is not based on transistors.\n\nAnother article: https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-moores-law-doesnt-apply-to-clean-technologies\n\nA more relevant question may be, can EV costs go down? One huge bottleneck then is material costs. \n\nWe may be hitting limits already.\n\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/as-battery-costs-plummet-lithium-ion-innovation-hits-limits-experts-say-58613238\n\n>While this will be accomplished without major innovations in lithium-ion batteries, mature lithium-ion technology is fast approaching limits to how much it can be improved, experts told S&P Global Market Intelligence. One battery chemist, a leading lithium-ion battery scientist who has conducted research for a major electric-vehicle maker that depends on the technology, said lithium-ion batteries have started to max out on certain fronts such as price, energy density and charging speed. \n\nIn a sense (but keep in mind of course that CPUs and EV battery costs are totally different), like CPUs before Pentium 4, we may  already seen the fastest rates of improvement already and the technology is maxing out. \n\n> Venkat Viswanathan, associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed the technology is nearing its limits. He expects that lithium-ion battery prices could still decline by about 20% and 30% but that they will not likely get much cheaper.\n> \n> \"We're quickly approaching the limits of raw material costs,\" Viswanathan said.\n\nPrices for lithium, cobalt, and various other elements on the periodic table that EVs need will be a major bottleneck. \n\n##Most of the current gains are one time gains that will not be repeated\n\nMany gains are \"1 time\" gains - to use an imperfect analogy again (and once again, I must emphasize that Moore's law is not to be compared with EV batteries, but I'll use it because EV enthusiasts insist on it), CPUs - moving the memory (DRAM) controller from the Northbridge (chipset) to the CPU die itself created a one time gain. AMD would do this with its K8 architecture and Intel would later do this with its Nehalem architecture.  For battery prices  though, it seems that there may have been quite a few more gains that are \"one time\".\n\nhttp://blog.gorozen.com/blog/how-low-can-lithium-ion-battery-costs-go\n\n>Our research indicates that neither the EV nor renewable power can gain material adoption without further major reductions in battery costs. Yes, battery costs have dropped dramatically over the last decade, but we believe these costs reductions were one-time in nature and will be near impossible to repeat. Further cost reductions will be entirely dependent on major advancements in battery technology, which, as of today, don\u2019t exist.\n\nSo basically saying the same thing I was.\n\n>Through our research, we came across an excellent book detailing the inner workings of the battery industry. In the Powerhouse, Steve LeVine explores the challenges in developing lithium-ion batteries.\n\n>He also describes the ground-breaking work conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago. Levine explains how Argonne maintained meticulous cost models for all major lithium-ion battery formulations over time and regularly released these models into the public domain.\n\n>Argonne\u2019s models are invaluable in understanding what caused the 80% fall in battery costs over the last seven years. After carefully analyzing the Argonne data, we now believe costs have come down mostly through a series of one-time improvements. Instead of continuing to fall materially (\u00e0 la Moore\u2019s Law), we believe that most of the drop in lithium-ion costs is now behind us. The first $600 move from $750 to $156 per kwh was relatively easy-- the next $56 move from $156 to $100 will be extremely difficult. If we are correct, lithium-ion batteries will not be able to reach the threshold for mass adoption in either EVs or grid-level storage for the foreseeable future. We should point out that many battery experts privately acknowledge that the trajectory of the past decade is not repeatable.\n\nSo in other words, most of these gains are not repeatable. \n\nThey go into  more detail in part 2:\n\nhttp://blog.gorozen.com/blog/how-low-can-lithium-ion-battery-costs-go-part-2\n\n>Beginning in 2008, the battery industry built a large amount of lithium-ion manufacturing capacity to meet the expected surge in demand. While the demand projections ultimately proved correct, the timing was initially far too optimistic and by 2010 the average battery plant only operated at 10% utilization. The low level of throughput resulted in substantial operational inefficiencies and artificially high unit costs. Argonne National Laboratory released a version of its model in late 2011 and we used this as a starting point for our analysis. The Argonne model assumes a 100,000 pack per year facility that operates at full capacity. The first thing we did was adjust the model to reflect a plant that only operated at 10% utilization. The result was a cost of $705 per kwh \u2013 within 5% of the battery cost reported by the battery industry for 2012.\n\nIt's not discussed in the article, but I suspect one of the reasons why progress slowed down was the 2008  recession, which the auto industry saw a number of failures. Indeed for most  companies in the industry, it was a struggle to survive. \n \n\n>Using this as a baseline, we adjusted the plant utilization to 100% \u2013 the base case used in the Argonne model. Immediately the costs collapsed by 50% from $705 per kwh to $360. These results have profound consequences: nearly 60% of the total cost savings of the past decade came from simply ramping up underutilized facilities. The cost savings is the result of the fixed or semi-fixed costs (such as capital equipment, land and labor) being amortized over a greater quantity of batteries. Battery manufacturing plants today are operating near full utilization. Going forward, additional demand will be met by building new plants and not by increasing utilization. As a result, the largest driver of cost reduction over the last decade is unrepeatable.\n\n>The second source of cost reduction is the size of the battery itself. In 2012 the average lithium-ion battery had much less capacity than today. For example, the benchmark battery from the 2011 Argonne model only had capacity of 11 kwh compared with 65 kwh in the most recent edition. In any battery pack there are significant costs that are incurred only once per battery. These costs include module terminals, gas release valves, bus bars, and pack jackets as well as various integration costs. By increasing the capacity of the battery five-fold, these one-time costs are spread over more kilowatt hours. In a typical 2012-vintage battery, these costs made up as much as 20% of the total battery cost. As the capacity increased materially, we estimate these costs came down from $80 to $20 per kwh--a reduction of 75%.\n\nSo again, more unrepeatable cost reductions.\n\nRecently Tesla pushed its 4680 battery (and the tabless battery).\n\nhttps://energycentral.com/c/cp/tesla-battery-day-one-slide\n\nWe are still chasing diminishing returns here. Like the memory controller example I referenced earlier, a tabless battery can only result in a \"one time\" savings. Larger batteries can only result in a \"one time\" reduction each time they are made larger and eventually, like how the semiconductor industry abandoned 450mm wafers, there will come a time where a larger battery does not outweigh the drawbacks. \n\nKeep in mind that this even assumes that the real world gains are as good as Tesla claims. Based on their self driving claims, let's just say there is ground for skepticism. \n\n>The third driver of cost reduction over the last several years has been chemical prices. A battery\u2019s \u201cchemistry\u201d typically refers to the active material used in the battery\u2019s cathode. For example, Tesla utilizes a so-called LCA battery where the cathode consists of a compound made of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and aluminum. This compound is purchased from a specialty chemical company which charges a price based upon the cost of the underlying materials and the cost of manufacturing. Over the last several years, the compound price has fallen by nearly 50% as manufacturing costs have declined materially. Our models suggest these cost savings have a limit as the raw material cost becomes a larger and larger percent of the total. For example, we estimate raw material costs made up 40% of chemical price in 2011. By 2018 this had flipped and the raw materials made up 60% of the total chemical price. Moreover, as battery demand picks up, we believe metal demand risks exceeding supply in cobalt and nickel. This will put upward pressure on the specialty chemical price.\n\nOne issue here is that high EV demand may be its own enemy - if demand for EV raw materials exceeds supply, it will  put an upwards pressure on the raw material prices. In other words, it's not different than oil or any other commodity - a function of market demand and supply along with other geopolitical events. \n\n>Our analysis suggests a full 80% of the cost savings of the last several years have come from one-time sources that cannot be repeated. Battery bulls extrapolate the 20% annual cost savings that took prices from $705 to $157 over the last several years. Instead, we believe it is more appropriate to first back-out the one-time cost savings in order to isolate the sustainable cost savings going forward. \n\nSo that is the pessimistic view.  80% of the costs are not repeatable. \n\n#A closer analysis \n\nIf we do see a slowdown at say, $100 USD per kwh, that means a 100 kwH battery will add $10000 USD per vehicle cost., if the rate of battery cost begins to decline. \n\nAlso, keep in mind what high EV adoption means. \n\n1. Oil prices would drop (and by extension gas) over time because more people are driving EVs.\n1. EV raw material prices would increase.  This would put pressure on nations that are heavily relying on EV vehicles. It may also lead to tensions as nations try to secure safe supplies.  \n1. Used car prices for ICE vehicles too might drop if EVs are seen as more desirable (keep in mind that depreciation is the largest cost of vehicle ownership in many jurisdictions). \n\nSo let's look at what the public is willing to pay: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/aaa-says-americans-warm-to-electric-cars-but-most-arent-ready-to-buy.html\n\nPart of the issue is consumer's lack of knowledge about EVs, but part of  the issue is that  consumers won't pay more.\n\n>And the AAA found 44% of buyers would be willing to pay up to $4,000 more for an electric vehicle than a gas model, with 23% willing to pay even more of a premium.\n\nOne issue - will 56% pay even less than $4,000 more per EV?  If the prices don't fall, it's less than a quarter  of the market that is achievable (and keep in mind my earlier post about public backlash to taxes that increase car vehicle costs - it will make the Yellow Vests look moderate). \n\nTo get say, 100 kwH battery at $4000, we would need $40  per kwH.  Less to access the 56% of the market that won't be able to pay even that.  The reason why I emphasize the 1000 kWh is because that's a \"guess\" as to where we would need range to be to ward off the worst of the range anxiety sentiment, although that number may be higher for pickup trucks (keep in mind in the US, the F-150 is the top selling vehicle). \n\nLet's keep in mind too that most people live paycheck to paycheck, so blaming them is pretty futile and may be blaming the victim. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html\n\nA more recent survey has said that consumers are even less willing to pay more.\n\nhttps://morningconsult.com/2021/02/09/energy-efficiency-series-electric-vehicles-consumers-polling/\n\n>According to a new Morning Consult survey, 47 percent of U.S. adults who don\u2019t already own an electric vehicle said their budget would be the same for an EV as it would be for a conventional vehicle; just 18 percent said they would be willing to spend more. \n\nOne possibility is that the coronavirus has worsened the budgets  of the general public. \n\n>Willingness to pay more correlated with income: 29 percent of those making over $100,000 per year said they would increase their car budget for an EV, while 14 percent of those making less than $50,000 annually said the same. \n\nKeep in mind even among the well off, less than 1 in 3 are willing to pay more. Also remember, not everyone making over 100k is rich, in the San Francisco Bay area for example, 100k is classified as \"low income\" due to the high living costs.\n\n>Asked to consider their range demands if money were no object and charging stations were plentiful, 23 percent of adults who don\u2019t already own an EV said they would require 500 miles or more. Just 7 percent selected less than 200 miles of range and another 16 percent chose  between 200 and 299 miles, options which represent the bulk of the current market. \n\nFor the ones needing 500 miles (800 km) or more, that would require a much larger than 100 kwH battery, especially for a pickup truck or a larger vehicle. \n\nAnother big issue is that ignorance about EVs works both ways. Most advocates for EVs recognize that most people don't know about battery technology and EVs and if they just knew, they would buy more EVs. Unfortunately, knowledge also has one big drawback.  EVs tend to lose range in colder and hotter climates. \n\nhttps://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-range/\n\nIf consumers knew, range anxiety might be an even bigger problem and consumers may demand an even bigger range as a \"temperature buffer\". Knowledge works both ways. \n\nSo in that regard, for EVs to drop in price, we would need:\n\n1. EV battery raw material costs to fall \n2. Greater range per kWh \n3. Newer battery chemistries that involve storing more joules with cheaper elements on the periodic table or more joules with the same amount of existing materials\n4. Some combination of the above\n\n2 is also exacerbated by the consumer shift towards CUVs and pickups, which tend to have worse energy consumption per unit of distance (A Crossover gets about 15% combined or so  worse consumption over a comparable sedan). \n\nThere are other issues - one is the number of charge / discharge cycles. The pursuit of cheaper batteries cannot come at  the expense of the lifespan of the battery or else consumers may also not accept  a battery that does not last as long. \n\n###Changing battery chemistry\n\nMost people are aware of the inherent limits of lithium ion batteries. \n\nThere are a number of technologies on the horizon:\n\n- Lithium air https://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=56929.php\n- Aluminum ion https://www.slashgear.com/aluminum-ion-batteries-charge-ten-times-faster-than-similar-lithium-ion-units-20673644/\n- Sodium ion https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/batteries-storage/sodium-ion-batteries-poised-to-pick-off-large-scale-lithium-applications\n- Zinc ion https://www.powermag.com/zinc-ion-batteries-are-a-scalable-alternative-to-lithium-ion/ \n\nThe reason why we haven't seen these come to a car is because it's not easy to change battery chemistries.  IT takes years from something going from lab to a product that you can buy. \n\nWe may see some of these new technologies by the late 2020s or 2030s, but a reliance on such new technology pushes the timeline of when EVs become mainstream back even more. \n\nOne possibility (and Tesla may have set a precedent with its LFP  battery) is that inferior batteries will go onto cheaper cars whereas the priciest cars get the best battery chemistry. \n\n#An optimistic view\n\nThe optimistic view is that batteries have a few more years to go.\n\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/analysis-reveals-plunge-in-lithium-ion-battery-costs-further-steep-declines-possible/\n\n\n\n> The researchers found that the cost of these batteries has dropped by 97 percent since they were first commercially introduced in 1991. This rate of improvement is much faster than many analysts had claimed and is comparable to that of solar photovoltaic panels, which some had considered to be an exceptional case. The new findings are reported today in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, in a paper by MIT postdoc Micah Ziegler and Associate Professor Jessika Trancik.\n> \n> While it\u2019s clear that there have been dramatic cost declines in some clean-energy technologies such as solar and wind, Trancik says, when they started to look into the decline in prices for lithium-ion batteries, \u201cwe saw that there was substantial disagreement as to how quickly the costs of these technologies had come down.\u201d Similar disagreements showed up in tracing other important aspects of battery development, such as the ever-improving energy density (energy stored within a given volume) and specific energy (energy stored within a given mass).\n> \n> \u201cThese trends are so consequential for getting us to where we are right now, and also for thinking about what could happen in the future,\u201d says Trancik, who is an associate professor in MIT\u2019s Institute for Data, Systems and Society. \n \nThis is basically saying battery prices fell a lot in the past and so we can project on that future price declines. \n\nThere are claims of $60 per kwh packs making an EV cost less than combustion engine cars.\n\nhttps://www.greencarreports.com/news/1132072_report-60-kwh-battery-pack-price-will-make-evs-cheaper-than-combustion\n\n>Granted, these analyses indicate battery costs aren't falling as rapidly as they were earlier last decade, but the turn rate should still put parity with internal combustion in sight.\n\nOne fly in the ointment here though - even though prices will still fall, the rate of decrease is slowing down. \n\nThe optimistic point of view is very simple - if we have enough years of the price falling, eventually it will reach price parity and even be cheaper than   ICE vehicles. \n\nIn such a situation, EV adoption might be quite high, provided charging capability is available (and the power grid can handle it - see https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/01/09/electric-cars-will-challenge-state-power-grids and https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-grids-autos-insight-idUSKBN2AX18Y) and EV batteries last long enough. If they do not, then these assumptions will not hold. \n\n##Even in this optimistic situation, most cars on the road will be ICE for some time\n\nLet me repeat an argument I have made before. \n\nEven in this situation, most cars  on the road will be ICE for quite some time. \n\nThe reason - take a look at the age of American vehicles. \n\n- https://news.ihsmarkit.com/prviewer/release_only/id/4759502/\n- https://www.wsj.com/articles/average-u-s-vehicle-age-hits-record-12-years-11623680640\n\nNote the average age in 2010.  About 10.6 years - 11.8 years in 2020 and  (at time of this writing) 12.1 years. \n\nSo by 2030, we can expect that cars will be perhaps 13.5 to 14 years old at this current rate. \n\nThis is caused by:\n\n1. The economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Many have seen their finances worsen and the \"K\" shaped recovery means the bottom 80% of society will recover less well than the top 20%.\n1. A chip shortage will last a couple of years. This should be resolved in the next couple of years, but for now will keep prices for cars higher. \n1. Rising demand   for used vehicles. \n1. Cars are getting more and more reliable, which means that there is less urgency to replace. Some brands like Toyota even sell very well based on their perceived reliability. \n1. People are leaving cities and less likely to use mass transit (more on that later) because this means that this will increase the demand for used vehicles. \n\nThis means the typical car  in 2030 will be a model year 2017 or 2016 vehicle. \n\nWE can extrapolate that if the age of cars  of 2040 will be mostly 2024 or 2025 model year cars (15-16 years old based on the IHS graph) too because the age of cars will go up again. Hint: Many of those will be mid-cycle refreshes of cars that are present today in model year 2021 or 2022 and therefore ICE cars. \n\nSo even in 2040, even under an optimistic scenario, there will be lots of ICE cars.\n\n##There is a shift away from mass transit \n\nFirst, I would like you to read this article: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/m056i9/why_our_reliance_on_cars_could_start_booming/\n\n>Reluctance to use public transport was at its highest in 18 years. Some 54% of respondents said safety was a top consideration, but only 43% agreed that they would use their cars less if public transport was improved, which was the lowest figure since 2002. \u201cThe pandemic had the effect of making drivers who already had cars realise that they would depend on them more than ever,\u201d says Rod Dennis, a data-insight spokesperson for RAC. \u201cThe million-dollar question is whether or not this is a deep-rooted change.\u201d \n\n>The generation that has been historically least interested in car ownership, Gen Z, may offer some clues. Auto Trader, a digital marketplace for cars, says 15% of its website audience in the UK between June and September was aged 18 to 24, compared to just 6% during the same period in 2019. Rory Reid, Auto Trader UK\u2019s YouTube director, noted that \u201cthe pandemic has shifted young people\u2019s views of car ownership and gotten them to hit the road earlier than usual, as they look to rely less on public transport and try to minimise risk of spreading coronavirus\u201d.\n\n>And, perhaps surprisingly, fears over the potential environmental risks of increased car use don\u2019t seem to be a top concern for many around the world. A YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project survey of 26,000 people from 25 countries showed that an overwhelming majority accept human responsibility for climate change. Yet the poll, conducted between July and August, found that the majority of respondents also plan to drive more in the future than they did in the past. For example, take Brazil, where 88% of respondents believed in human-induced climate change. Some 60% of those same people said they would use their car more after the pandemic than before, while just 12% said they would use it less. More than 40% of respondents in the US and Australia also said they would drive more after the pandemic compared to just 10% who said they\u2019d drive less. \n\n\nOne of the lasting effects of the coronavirus  even long after the pandemic is over will be a shift  in behavior. To give an example, we may have lasting effects on fearing crowds even well after the pandemic. \n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/coronavirus-will-we-ever-trust-crowds-again-cvd   (https://archive.ph/bRqrV  if you are asked for your email)\n\nWork from home or a hybrid of partly at home, partly in office for many white collar workers (ex: those who are more likely to have the economic means to buy new cars) may remain.  Technologies like VPNs, meetings on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, etc, will remain even after the pandemic. \n\nMore people have left for the suburbs, which means greater car dependency.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemic-supercharged-changes-in-where-americans-live-11619536399 (https://archive.ph/5V0Aj)\n\nMany of these people will remain in the suburbs after the pandemic - the issue is that not everyone will buy a new car - that means there will be more people who want to buy the same number of used cars (that were made a couple of years ago or older - before the pandemic and increased demand for vehicles). \n\nOther issue such as politics, civil unrest, crime, etc, have all had lasting effects on where people move as well. Net though, it would appear that a higher percentage of people are moving to the more auto dependent suburbs, a trend likely to hold after the pandemic. \n\nThat shift away means that fewer can buy used cars (which are now more expensive). Considering most could not afford new cars to begin with (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/28/that-shiny-new-car-is-out-of-reach-for-many-americans.html), that means that older cars will remain on the roads.  Keep in mind that not everyone moving to the suburbs will be wealthy. \n\n###The suburbs hold the political power \n\nIn many developed nations, the medium density areas are the politically swing areas (rural tends to be conservative and urban tends to be politically liberal). \n\n- 2012 http://davetroy.com/posts/the-real-republican-adversary-population-density\n- 2016 https://climatechangefork.blog.brooklyn.edu/2016/12/06/election-urban-rural-voter-density/\n- 2020 https://engaging-data.com/election-population-density/\n\n\nThe one major consideration is that policies that are hostile to the suburbs (and therefore the automobile) are a one way ticket to electoral defeat. \n\nIf a greater percentage of people move to the suburbs, this will increase the \"swing\" nature of politics not decrease it. \n\n#What does all of this mean?\n\nIn general, we can split people between those who are optimistic about EVs and those who are not. Optimists tend to take the existing EV tends of rapidly falling prices and assume that they will continue for a long time, if not forever. \n\nIf they do not fall, then we are left with challenges. \n\n##Hydrogen cars\n\nHydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen combustion, which Toyota has recently experimented with are one possibility.  Toyota in particular has been skeptical of EVs (https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyotas-chief-says-electric-vehicles-are-overhyped-11608196665) and feels that ICE bans would make cars unattainable for most people. \n\nIf the costs fall faster relative to EV cars, then hydrogen may very well prove to be the superior option. \n\nThis becomes even more paramount  if the costs of batteries do indeed stop falling and newer battery chemistries are hard to come by. \n\n1. If EV costs do fall and H2 doesn't, EV will win except where energy density (Ex: in aviation) is critical\n2. Another possibility is the 2 exist side by side. https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/020421-bevs-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-to-complement-not-compete-in-medium-term\n3.  If EV costs do stagnate and H2 falls, then H2 becomes dominant (this appears to be what Toyota expects) \n4. Which brings us to the last outcome, if neither falls, ICE will remain for longer than many hope\n\n\n##If neither H2 or EVs can match the costs, then ICE remains for a lot longer than many hope\n\nThis is a \"bad\" outcome as far as global warming goes, but it is a possibility. \n\nIF neither EVs nor hydrogen cars gets to the price point we need, it may be the end result.  \n\nRefer to my post earlier - most people will not tolerate the kind of bans  necessary on vehicles. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/klkdjy/some_thoughts_about_why_you_need_to_be_skeptical/\n\nIn an electoral democracy, that makes it very challenging to address the issues of global warming and for a politician to be re-electable.\n\nEven in an authoritarian nation, the government has to satisfy the needs to the people or else they will lose legitimacy as well. \n\n\n#Potential Consequences\n\nI think that one possibility is that we might have no other choice than resort to geoengineering. It's not the outcome I wanted, but it might be given human nature the only real possibility. \n\nOther scientists have felt so as well:\n\n- https://www.wired.com/story/more-scientists-now-think-geoengineering-may-be-essential/ (https://archive.ph/Yq2Kf)\n- https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-geoengineering-should-be-investigated-scientists-say/ (https://archive.ph/wip/zQnlA)\n\nCurrent projections show even the Paris agreement to be inadequate. \n\nhttps://sustainabilitycommunity.springernature.com/posts/limiting-warming-to-2-c-requires-emissions-reductions-80-above-paris-agreement-targets\n\nThe question becomes is this politically possible in a democracy or even an  authoritarian society? This would require a substantial loss in the living standards of most people that may not be politically feasible. \n\n2 out of 3 Americans for example will not pay more than $10 a month in power bills to address global warming. Keep in mind that if EVs are to lower greenhouse gas emissions, it has to come from renewable sources of energy. \n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/more-americans-believe-global-warming-they-won-t-pay-much-n962001\n\nThis has huge implications on the roll-out of renewable energy which tends to be intermittent.  It's been suggested that changes in how we price electricity have to be made.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmurray1/2019/06/17/the-paradox-of-declining-renewable-costs-and-rising-electricity-prices/?sh=e9bd78561d5b\n\nI hope you understand the magnitude of the problems that we face. Is it even possible to operate an industrial civilization with this type of pricing? What sort of hedging will be needed for electricity costs? \n\nIt's for these reasons I think we may have to spend a lot of money on geoengineering, even if it carries enormous risks. \n\nThe other is that I've learned not to judge people as harshly as some might. Some people may judge very harshly Americans for not being willing to pay more costs  for global warming for example.  \n\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/ev3dde/most-money-advice-is-worthless\n\n\n> I recently spoke with Linda Tirado, who wrote Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America, which details her experiences with (and misconceptions about) low-income life. Trying to align with the standard expectation of how to interact with your money when you\u2019re low income, she tells me, is useless: \u201cYou are adapting to your circumstances, thinking in the short term. It would be maladaptive for a low wage worker to set even middle class financial goals. It doesn\u2019t make sense to maintain a savings account if you can\u2019t pay your rent.\u201d Lots of recent research on the topic backs her viewpoint.\n> \n> As Tirado explains, \"if you\u2019re working low wages, the whole concept of saving and investing goes away because you don\u2019t have the luxury of that long term; it\u2019s hypothetical.\u201d\n> \n> I often ask myself: how come I\u2019m working all the time, my body is breaking down, I\u2019ve cut and tightened every way I can think of, and despite how much I\u2019m sacrificing, I still can\u2019t manage to make rent? It\u2019s at this point that poor person brain blossoms: I\u2019m still going to struggle whether or not I buy a bag of chips, so I might as well buy the chips. As Tirado puts it, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to put anything off for the long term if there is no long term that will be better than today.\u201d\n> \n> Buy the chips. Have you a good time, before your time is up. The immediate necessity for psychological survival negates the bogus narrative that you just have to work harder, and it\u2019ll get better when you know it won\u2019t.\n\nThe people in charge have built an economic system where too high a percentage of people are in such a precarious economic state. \n\nIt is \"dumb\" in a sense to not think longer term, but it also makes sense in a way as well. This inability to think longer term due to barely making ends meet (or not making ends meet at all due to poverty) also in my view explains the lack of prioritization of global warming. \n\nWith around 80% of the US living paycheck to paycheck pre-COVID (and possibly an even higher number now), that would explain the inability to plan longer term. \n\n**The people who judge most harshly their fellow citizens for not being willing to pay for global warming tend to themselves be upper middle class and economically secure.** \n\nHere is a very good article:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/opinion/sunday/yellow-vest-protests-climate.html (https://archive.ph/CbarE)\n\nAt the risk of drifting off topic, I've become a very left wing person economically (I have been downvoted and called a Marxist on /r/canada), although quite right wing socially, but that reflects how I see the world now - I think that inequality has become one of the biggest obstacles for our world. \n\nToday, EVs are a luxury vehicle for the upper middle class and rich. \n\nIf wages do not rise dramatically and/or EV costs do not fall, the risk is that they will remain that way.  This is not a \"good\" outcome, but unless another technology (such as hydrogen) does save the day, we could be in very  serious trouble. \n\nEVs won't single-handedly save  our world (after all aviation and other sources of carbon emissions exist), but either a transition to EV or H2 would be a step in the right direction. \n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport\n\n\nAlso, we should bear in mind that all car manufacturing has lifecycle emissions. One reason why I focused on electricity was due to impacts on where electricity comes from. \n\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change\n\nHydrogen will still have a role to play even in this situation. Unless there are huge improvements in energy density, it is likely that for long range applications, EVs will not be suitable because they are too heavy.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#/media/File:Energy_density.svg\n\nWeight is a huge issue in areas like aviation, so hydrogen is a necessity. \n\n###Many EV owners don't actually care\n\nAnother big hypocrisy I've noticed is that many wealthy EV owners don't actually care about the environment or themselves are unwilling to make the sacrifices needed. I think that this should be judged more harshly than those living paycheck to paycheck in my opinion.\n\nIn many ways, EVs have been a sort of \"let's pretend to care\" fraud of sorts that seems convincing to the casual observer for the wealthy.\n\n###What if nothing happens \n\nThe problem of course, is if our actions to address global warming are inadequate. \n\nThe reason why there is an emphasis on 2 degrees is because past 2 degrees, the planet creates a feedback loop that worsens global warming (ex: there are large methane traps under Siberia and northern Canada for example, along with methane clathrates under our oceans). \n\nThe end result could be a Permian like extinction event. Most people know about the famous KT extinction event 65 million years ago that eradicated the dinosaurs.  That was not the worst  extinction in earth's history,  which was the end Permian, which was caused by volcanic activity that resulted in a global warming event on a massive scale. \n\n#Final thoughts\n\nA lot of people seem to think that the EV skeptics \"want\" EVs to fail.  \n\nOn the contrary, EVs failing is not at all a desirable outcome. I think Musk is a very unethical con artist, and should be brought to justice for his actions, but I do not wish for EVs as a whole to fail. \n\nIt's actually in our interests for both EVs and Hydrogen cars to be spectacularly successful. Hydrogen could also serve as an energy storage as well for intermittent renewable energy too.\n\nHowever, I am also not ignorant as to the barriers that EVs will face. Hydrogen too faces its own challenges, but that's for another article. Even if successful, EVs cannot be save the world alone, Musk's claims aside. \n\nThe reason why I am in favor of pushing for geoengineering isn't because I want our efforts at global warming mitigation to fail - it's because I see no alternative given our political realities and because I'm aware of the danger if nothing happens.", "Evansville READI Regional Development Plan Outlines Major Community Improvements The Evansville Regional Economic Partnership (E-REP) earlier this month released their submission for a cut of Indiana's $500 million Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative (READI) program.\n\nThose receiving funds should know by the end of December.\n\nThe plan itself is outlined in 128 pages [here](https://evansvilleregion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/READI-Regional-Development-Plan.pdf) (yes the document is 292 pages long, everything after 128 is appendix information).\n\nI'll give a relatively brief outline of the document below but for those who want the bare minimum highlights:\n\n* The plan outlines goals to:\n   * Bring at least 5,000 new high-paying job opportunities to the region\n   * Increase the region's population by 10,000 residents, with half of them being young adults\n   * Maintain and develop a highly trained workforce that is **globally** competitive and relevant\n   * Reduce the percentage of households living in poverty\n   * Improve the quality and quantity of residents' lives and health\n* The plan works hand-in-hand with the [Evansville Talent 2025 initiative](https://www.growthallianceevv.com/blog/talent-2025-greater-evansville-talent-initiative), whose goals (Employment and Wage Growth, Population Growth, etc.) almost directly align with the READI program's goals\n* E-REP plans to implement a regional marketing strategy\n* The plan outlines an initiative to work with [TMap](https://www.tmap.com/), an Indianapolis based company that leverages technology to build talent pipelines\n* A renovation of Evansville's riverfront is included in the plan (renderings on page 102)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Complete Plan Outline**\n\n**- Goals** (p. 3)\n\n* Be deliberate about bringing 5,000 high-paying new job opportunities to our region that build on our strong manufacturing history and secure its future.

This is always *the* most important part of any creative solution.\u00a0\n\nHe listed out his whole sales process in minute detail. Then he systematically went through all the tiny elements to see what he could do to solve the problem.\u00a0\n\nFerris\u2019 analysis discovered the problem wasn\u2019t his pitch, his closing, the product, or even the price.\u00a0\n\nThe problem was he wasn\u2019t getting hold of enough prospects in order to pitch.\u00a0\n\nThe question was why?\n\nThe answer was the prospect\u2019s secretaries were blocking his calls.\u00a0\n\nHow did Ferris resolve it?\u00a0\n\nHe called out of business hours when the secretaries weren\u2019t there.\n\nThis simple solution increased Tim's sales by 90%.\n\n# How to Rule the World with Creative Strategy\n\nIn 2002, British cycling had only won one gold medal in the previous 76 years, and no British cyclist had ever won the Tour de France in 110 years of trying.\n\nThings were so bad one of the top European cycling brands refused to sell bikes to the British as they were concerned it would be a bad look for their company.\u00a0\n\nThen things changed. Dave Brailsford was the new Performance Director. He relentlessly believed in the *aggregated marginal gains strategy.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Brailsford said, \u201cThe whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the 5 million people who has read James Clear\u2019s book, *Atomic Habits,* you will recall this story from chapter one.\n\nWhat Atomic Habits doesn\u2019t do is break down the *full* strategy Dave Brailsford executed to disrupt professional cycling and become the most successful sports team in the world.\n\nBritish cycling used the slice and dice framework.\n\n>\u201cWhat was great was we weren\u2019t held back by *conventional wisdom*.

Break down everything you need to do in order to provide the market more value than your competitors \u2014 work out how to improve each minute element.\n\n# Step 2 \u2014 The Audit\n\nThis is where you assess your strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\nThis tells you exactly where you are. You already know where you want to be from step 1.\n\n>\u201cHave we got a bridgeable gap? That analysis of the bridgeable gap and how we can breach it is the fundamentals of our strategy\u201d\u00a0\u2014 **Sir Dave Brailsford**\n\n# Step 4 - The Human Mind\n\nWhy is this so important? Well, humans more often than not perform below their skill set.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause there\u2019s a conversation between the limbic system (emotional monkey brain) and our frontal lobes. We exist in our frontal lobe. It controls impulses and considers consequences, whereas the limbic system is run on pure emotion.\n\nThe Parietal lobe is basically a computer with all our beliefs, values, learned skills, and motor neuron behaviors.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn order to achieve optimal human performance, you run the parietal lobe (computer) without your limbic system (monkey brain) and your frontal lobe activated.\u201d \u00a0\n\nDave and his team created a program based on ownership management theory to build an environment of optimal performance within their staff and riders.\n\n# C.O.R.E\n\n* **Commitment**\n* **Ownership**\n* **Responsibility**\n* **Excellence**\n\n>***Give committed people ownership and responsibility and they will achieve excellence***\n\nIn all sports, the coaching management style is based on dictate and control.\n\nMost companies are run in the same manner. They dictate strategy and control to their teams.\u00a0\n\nDave Brailsford felt this was wrong. Dictating and controlling riders was only going to agitate their money brains and they wouldn\u2019t be as motivated or have the tools to achieve optimal performance.\n\nThey gave the riders and team ownership. Everybody was expected to have opinions on their training and development.\u00a0\n\nThey encouraged a diversity of thinking. They try and work with a collective opinion where possible. Giving the riders ownership and responsibility for their training and development generated extremely high levels of intrinsic motivation and performance.\n\nYou can achieve the same within your team.\n\n# Aggregated marginal gains ( Slice and Dice)\n\nAt the start of the process, Brailsford and his coaches had broken down exactly what they needed to do in order to win in minute detail.\n\nNow they started making those tiny changes to improve every minute element to be 1% better. Changes that on their own seem irrelevant or even silly but when combined the sum of the parts creates an environment that allowed Team Sky to disrupt competitive cycling and gain a competitive advantage.\u00a0\n\n# Some of Team Sky\u2019s Marginal Gains\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* They made the bike seats more comfortable.\u00a0\n* They rubbed alcohol onto the tyres to get more grip.\n* Riders wore heat pads under their shorts to keep their muscles at the optimum temperature.\u00a0\n* They tested massage gels for the fastest recovery times.\n* Hand sanitisers placed everywhere to minimise the risk of colds\n* They toured with the rider\u2019s mattresses and pillows so the sleeping environment was consistent.\n* They painted the inside of trucks white to spot any dust on the bikes that could slow the rider down by even a fraction.\u00a0\n\nThis is the level of detail you need to bring to your business if you want to be the best in class. Break down your processes, the customer\u2019s journey, and each touchpoint into minute detail.\n\nHow can you improve the product or service to make your customer\u2019s experience better?\n\n**How might you create more value for your customers in a unique way?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When everyone in the team is consistently looking to improve every tiny detail it is an incredibly positive environment to work in that encourages everyone to perform at their absolute best. \u201d \u2014 **Chris Froome, 4 x winner of Tour de France and 2 x Gold Olympic medal winner.**\n\n# Conclusion\u00a0\n\nDo the following steps to create a strategy that will give you a competitive advantage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Create a challenge statement**\n* **Deep situational analysis** **( Slice and Dice)**\n\nWhat does it take to win? How can give the most value in your segment?\u00a0\n\nWrite out your whole process in minute detail and analyse every tiny detail on how you can improve the experience for your customers with your product or service.\n\nUse innovation frameworks to brainstorm a list of customer friction points and invert them to create solutions to even the tiniest of problems.\u00a0Remember it\u2019s the combined marginal gains that make a big difference.\n\nThis gives you the end game\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do An Audit**\n\nCreate a SWOT analysis of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This tells where you are now and the bridgeable gap of where you want to go.\n\nUse the gap between where you are ( SWOT) and where you want to be  ( Slice and Dice) to build your precise strategy that breaches the gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Create An Innovation Culture (C.O.R.E)**\n\nGet your team to co-create projects and strategies. Give them co-ownership and responsibility for strategic vision within reason. Make them feel *truly* part of the future of the company.\u00a0\n\nUse innovation frameworks and creative thinking sessions to create new solutions and products that will serve your customers better.\u00a0\n\n**Solve new problems.\u00a0Or solve the same old problems, differently.**\n\nThis will generate high levels of intrinsic motivation and commitment within your team to excel.\u00a0\n\n>***\u201cCommitted teams who are given ownership and responsibility will achieve excellence.\u201d \u2014*** **Sir Dave Brailsford**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Execute Aggregated Marginal Gains**In Japanese culture, they call it *Kaizen*. It\u2019s also called the Toyota way as continuous improvement was one of the key strategies Toyota executed to become the second biggest car manufacturer on the planet.\n\n**Return to your Slice and Dice list and execute your aggregated marginal gains strategy by improving every minute detail that will improve your process/the customer journey/ experience.**\n\nThe strategy is not to achieve *operational excellence.* Being the best is not a strategy.\n\nThe strategy is to create unique value for the market in a unique way and *deliver it with operational excellence.*\n\nDo all this and you will become the best in class. Your customers will be delighted and create word of mouth.\n\nYou will disrupt your market segment and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThis is a big job. It\u2019s a fairly large time commitment.\n\nBut being the uniquely best at what you do was never going to be easy.\n\nIt takes strategy and execution.\n\nGood luck with it \u270c\ufe0f\n\nEDIT to add PDF cheat sheet [https://www.dropbox.com/s/dxlgshv9e7e27am/Slice%20and%20Dice%20pdf.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dxlgshv9e7e27am/Slice%20and%20Dice%20pdf.pdf?dl=0)", "Google Drive eTextbooks release thread (part-21)!+ Accepting requests every day * **If you find your book in the thread below, send the number of the book via** **reddit chat or via** [**Telegram**](https://t.me/textbookrequestservice)**.**\n* **Almost all the books are in their latest editions and some of them are available in multiple editions too.**\n* **Books are delivered through Google-Drive link.**\n* **You can also send requests via reddit chat or by** [**Telegram**](https://t.me/textbookrequestservice)**.**\n* **Also, upvote the post if you found it useful.**\n\nPlease find the list below:\n\n6287.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR TESLA?! [https://youtu.be/3Q7yruXSJ-g](https://youtu.be/3Q7yruXSJ-g)\n\nIn no less than a week after his SNL appearance, Elon Musk made a big announcement regarding the purchases of Tesla vehicles with Bitcoin. Here's the full quote: Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel. Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment. Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction.\n\nWith this announcement, the price of Bitcoin dropped 5% in an hour and about about 15% in two hours, along with the rest of the crypto market. A lot of Tesla fans and well-known enthusiasts chimed in with mixed reactions. Gary Black, Michael Saylor, Meet Kevin, Anthony Pompliano, Dave Lee, Peter Schiff - some approved, some disapproved, and one, Dave Lee, asked if Telsa would create their own coin. That would be interesting if they did that. More on that later in the video.\n\nThis information is lot to take in and it was a bold move by Tesla to go with this decision. It hasn't even been 2 months since Tesla started accepting Bitcoin payments on March 24th. They originally bought Bitcoin into their balance sheet in early February. IMO I thought it was a great idea For Tesla to accept bitcoin because it brought adoption to the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nIf you remember, the news of that pushed many investors and companies to consider Bitcoin in their balance sheet or as an investment. Square and Microstrategy are two well known companies that have Bitcoin in their balance sheet. Palantir actually recently announced in their earnings call that they'll consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet. Here's what their CFO had to say about having Bitcoin on its balance sheet.\"\n\nThe short answer is yes. We're thinking about it, and we've even discussed it internally. Take a look at our balance sheet, $2.3 billion in cash at quarter end, including $151 million in adjusted free cash flow in Q1. So it's definitely on the table from a treasury perspective as well as other investments as we look across our business and beyond. On the other side of that, in terms of accepting Bitcoin from our customers, we do accept it. That's more convenient. We're open for business there.\n\nSo now that Tesla is not accepting Bitcoin for payments, there's a few concerns that were initially brought up - 1) it makes it seem like Elon was hustling people 2) it's a bad look for the company to backtrack on its decision, and 3) why didn't Elon and Tesla think about this before, 2 months ago?. Afterall, Elon did state Dogecoin is a hustle on SNL this past weekend....so people are going to associate Dogecoin with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole is all a pyramid scheme. The cryptocurrency market is a sensitive topic because it competes with the US dollar and other fiat currencies.  With this announcement, it makes cryptocurrency not so appealing for new investors, institutional investors, and corporations.\n\nThere are many ways to view Elon's and Tesla's decision to eliminate Bitcoin payments.\n\nLet's first address the environmental impact. Quickly looking up the environmental impact of the bitcoin network (includes mining and transaction costs), I get an answer of 129 terrawatt-hours annually. This is in comparison to other countries like China with 6.5 thousand terrawatt-hours and the U.S. with almost 4,000 terrawatt-hours. All of the worlds data centers generates about 50% more energy than Bitcoin's network.\n\nBecause there's a lot of talk about Bitcoin's harmful environmental impact, let's look at the energy share cryptominers use. 76% of cryptominers rely on some form of renewable energy but those renewables account for only 39% of cryptomining. Hydroelectric energy is the most common source globally, and it gets used by at least 60% of cryptominers across all four regions. Other types of clean energy such as wind and solar appear to be less popular as its more costly to set up.\n\nAnother take to Tesla not accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment anymore is some speculation Tesla will create their own currency. Tesla is a green energy solution to cars but wanted to use the least energy efficient cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Obviously this doesn't align with their mission statement so Elon and Tesla create this publicity to hype up cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Dogecoin. The publicity to dump Bitcoin as a form of payment will probably be worth it to them anyway because I couldn't have seen anyone using an appreciating asset, Bitcoin, to buy a depreciating asset, a Tesla vehicle. So what if Tesla creates their own currency that could be mined by their own network that is mined or generated by their solar roofs and power walls? Could be interesting...\n\nESG Funds pressure. Back in In April, The S&P500 committee announced Tesla will be added to their ESG index fund. For those unfamiliar with ESG, it's environmental, social, and governmence - It's basically an investment criteria used for funds to set a standard for a company's operations. ESG scores are rated from 0-100. If a company has a low ESG score, it is doing well managing risks to internal and external factors that would impact the enterprise value of the company. The opposite is true for a high ESG score, where a company is impacted heavily by internal and external factors.\n\nAs it currently stands, Tesla has a score of 31.3 which is considered high risk. It is ranked 50th out of 72 auto companies. In comparison to other automakers, here's where Tesla stands. Damlier ranked 22nd, Toyota, 44th, Honda 38th, and Volkswagon 54th. The highest score on the list was taken by Hyundai with a score of 36.2 and the lowest score, a 12.5, was given to Herp MotoCorp, an auto company in India.\n\nSo why does Tesla rank so high in comparison to ICE vehicle manufacturers? Is Bitcoin a reason for the high score? Possibly. One article suggested that Bitcoin is an incredibly energy inefficient way of transferring wealth and that Tesla's substantial investment in cryptocurrency will have a significant negative impact on its ESG rating.\" From an ESG perspective, the company has everything to lose and nothing to gain. It had a \u201cnear-perfect\u201d carbon reduction score in 2020. This suggests that unless the company and its management take action to offset the extra emissions created by using Bitcoin, the ESG rating will suffer. The social impact on Bitcoin from policymakers and authorities have seen concerns over the years too. Criminal activity is to blame but that's been debunked many times because anyone can check blockchain transactions online. U.S. dollar bills are used by criminals all the time and it cannot be tracked.", "[DIPLOMACY] India Seeks International Cooperation on 'Greening' its Economy #August 2021\n\nThe Indian Government has made moves seeking to hold a major international conference in New Delhi on what the Prime Minister has called 'Greening the Economy', that is, establishing how India can develop its economy, grow its wealth and improve the lives of its citizens without negatively impacting on the environment.  Indeed, the PM has laid out his belief, in which he has been joined by the leader of the opposition, that the economic sustainability of India's economy is vital not just for its own survival, but the survival of the world.  \n\nIndia is not just interested in its own path, but in fostering connections between a great many companies, countries, NGOs, individuals and so on.  To that end the Indian government will be inviting representatives to a major 'Green Buisness Expo', that it now hopes to hold every two years in India, and will hope that leading lights in the world will attend to network.  \n\nThis expo, to be called 'GreenEx' will be held next May in New Delhi.\n\nIndia will be inviting representatives from major 'tech economies' which may be interested in selling to India or, better yet, be interested in putting their products into mass manufacture in India:\n\n* Japan - An Invitation will be extended to several Japanese firms.  Fujitsu for example, alongside car manufacturers Toyota, Suzuki and Nissan who produce hybrid and electric vehicles.  \n\n* Germany - Firms such as Siemens, BMW and Volkswagen will be invited.  \n\n* France - French firms such as EDF will be invited to the Expo to showcase their technology, while french auto company Renault will be invited to display it's electric vehicle technology.\n\n* USA - From the USA of course many firms will be invited, but the event organisers are most keen of all to see Boeing, General Electric and, if possible, Tesla flaunt their wares at the expo.\n\nIn addition business leaders in India are to be invited, community leaders too, and some of the leading academics of the world, from environmental scientists to demographers to experts in town planning.  ", "Terminology, which can be pedantic **Terminology, some misleading things to be alert for people saying, and some suggestions on words to use or not use**\n\n*But first -There's an excellent [post (elsewhere)](\nhttps://www.sightline.org/2014/01/09/the-art-of-talking-climate-science-2/) about climate comm for scientists, saying \"Choose plain language over technical terms, insider jargon, and acronyms\" -  and it includes a table of meanings, that gives the scientific term, its contrary meaning to your public audience, and a better choice of wording that communicates better. (See bottom of this post for suggested additional terms&replacements.)*\n\n----\n\n*Also: I am NOT THE EXPERT.

CO2, H20, methane are some.  Some stay there only for a few days (H20), others for centuries? (with CO2, the *increase* stays for much much longer, because we've taken it from deep underground (where it was inert) and added it to the carbon cycle. ).  Molecule for molecule, some GHGs are much stronger than CO2 (methane and some refrigerants) - but they're \"short-lived climate pollutants\", SLCPs) - methane for one will relatively quickly degrade into CO2.  (Basically, CO2 is the \"control knob\" for earth's temperature  ([see 1-hr AGU (amer.geophys.union) talk by Alley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffPSrRpq_g)).) \n* Natural gas = \"fossil gas\".  ([source](https://twitter.com/JustinHGillis/status/1215043822427803649))\n* **Carbon cycle** - Carbon from the CO2 in the air naturally goes into water, is taken into plants, re-emerges when they rot.  Much longer term (millions of years), it reacts and becomes bound up in some rocks, via [rock weathering](https://skepticalscience.com/weathering.html).\n* A **Carbon source** emits CO2, a **Carbon sink** takes it up.  Seawater is a carbon sink.  Trees are carbon sinks until they die or burn.\n* (\"**Tons of carbon**\" and \"**tons of CO2**\" are sometimes used interchangeably, but they shouldn't.  The same amount of *carbon* (C) emitted into the atmosphere is only [1/4](https://twitter.com/mtobis/status/1141063848973230081) the tonnage as when it's communicated as tons of *CO2* (because of those 2 oxygen atoms).  (Aside: 'tons' seems like a counterintuitive measure, for anyone who thinks of air as weightless.  In some contexts ppm (parts per million, concentration) is a better one.  In others it isn't.) *( how to do better?)*  (\"A gallon of gasoline, which weighs about 6.3 pounds, produces 20 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned... To calculate the amount of CO2 produced from a gallon of gasoline, the weight of the carbon in the gasoline is multiplied by 44/12 or 3.7...The carbon in a gallon of gasoline weighs 5.5 pounds\" ([link](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentIncludes/co2_inc.htm))))\n* **Clean energy** is **Renewables** (wind,solar, tides, hydropower) plus **nuclear power** (and geothermal, or does that count as renewable?).  It just doesn't include fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas).\n* **Energy** is all forms of energy.  Sometimes people say 'energy' when they mean just **electricity** (as in, \"100% clean e...\" to mean \"make the electrical grid be made up of all-clean sources.\"). *(how to word this better?)*\n* **Greenhouse effect** - CO2 traps heat, and so does the glass of a greenhouse (*even though the actual mechanism isn't the same, it's still useful for understanding*).  Without this effect, we'd be on Snowball Earth.  On the other hand, too much heat isn't good either.\n* **'committed emissions'**, the CO2 emissions (ergo additional warming) that are already **\"in the pipeline\"** (*'pipeline' is metaphorical here*): \"If every car, pipeline *(literal)*, and power plant around today were allowed to keep operating until it broke down, and no other new fossil-fuel infrastructure was built, they would still lock in enough carbon emissions to shoot Earth well past 1.5 degrees of warming, according to a [recent study](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/01072019/climate-change-lock-in-fossil-fuel-power-plants-paris-goals-nature-study).\" ([link](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/how-think-about-dire-new-ipcc-climate-report/595705/))\n* \"**duck curve**\" - over a day, the demand for power that's not met by solar (or other renewable) power generation(?) (looks like the underside of a duck; [read here](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/9/17336330/duck-curve-solar-energy-supply-demand-problem-caiso-nrel)).\n* \"**curtailment**\" - when the grid 'dumps' excess solar power because it has no immediate use for it.\n* \"**adoption curve**\" - the rate at which a tech. shift occurs.  For staying below 1.5C, this now must be abrupt. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc4wDL16-hU&feature=youtu.be&t=43)) \n* **CO2e** and **GWP** - see the ['background - greenhouse gases' page] for now.  Short for CO2-equivalent and global warming potential (for a comparison of various other greenhouse gases to co2)  (or better yet, see wikipedia)\n\n**Science** terms:\n\n  * Consensus.  \"When scientists talk about consensus, they mean consensus in the **peer-reviewed literature**, not a vote of scientists' opinions.\" ([source](https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/1150439780548825092)) \n  * \"Mundane science\"([pdf](https://rael.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kammen-Dove-Mundane_Science_Environment_1998.pdf)) - (the simple stuff, to solve global problems (e.g. third world cookstoves), with outsized payback.\n\n**climate change effects**, related terms\n\n* **Ocean acidification** - when CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid.   Larval crustaceans' protective shells dissolve, etc.   Even if we were able to control the earth's heat imbalance from the buildup of CO2, ocean acidification would transform the oceans, resulting in fewer fish, more jellyfish.  (and no coral?)\n* **Global warming** - the extra heat formed when there is increasing atmospheric CO2 (from burning fossil fuels), which traps heat.  (It sounds globally comfy, which it isn't and won't be.)\n* **Global heating**.  Sounds just like global warming but more so, doesn't bring to mind the other effects of increased GHGs on the oceans, hurricanes, rainfall etc.\n* **Global climate disruption** - the increased atmospheric CO2 causes a global energy imbalance between incoming & outgoing energy, which makes for all sorts of changes.  Increased global surface temperature is just one of them - ocean acidification, increased floods drought and wildfires, and (unproven but likely) a loopy jetstream ( maybe [not from Arctic sea ice loss](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/14/arctic-sea-ice-loss-may-not-be-causing-cold-winters-us-asia-after-all-study-finds/)? *keyword jet stream*) that gets fixed in 1 place & doesn't wobble around day by day like it used to (and so, gives us days of the same weather, which can produce extremes of rainfall etc), warm surface waters that make hurricanes stronger, a melting Arctic whose meltwater may slow the 'heat conveyor' ocean current that keeps Europe warm, sea level rise that inundates our big coastal cities and much of Florida, etc.  We don't know what [other climate change risks (page)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActOnClimate/comments/cacrso/other_climate_change_risks/) there will be.  (The opposite of global climate disruption is: a stable climate, which is what we humans need to fight for.

([@mtobis](https://www.twitter.com/mtobis) has [explained here](https://twitter.com/mtobis/status/1103671224142581761)).  \n* \"**Global change**\" - a term that obscures good vs. bad kinds of change, leaving the listener free to assume that the outcome could be fine.  When your society is well-suited to a particular climate (and sea level),  disruptive changes to that climate aren't going to be helpful.  (Topsoil is located where the climate has been good for growing crops, and as optimal-crop-climate moves north, in North America it will hit the [Canadian Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield), rock with thin layer of soil). Also, re good&bad change, \"global change\" brings to mind the aspirational \"hope and change\" (though climate change as a phenomenon isn't going to be good, even for formerly cold places - think crop failures, and refugees from no-longer-habitable regions or from wars from shortages.)\n* **Stationarity** - the assumption that things will be, and behave, pretty much like they used to - that infrastructure can still get built as it used to, to handle the same expected 100-year rainfall events, etc.  With climate change, stationarity goes out the window.\n* \"threat multiplier\"\n* \"heat index\" - a measure of how hot it actually feels to humans, includes humidity (and ?)\n* \"Rossby waves\" (aka 'planetary waves') formed by a meandering jet stream  - see wikipedia\n* \"heat domes\" - \"as the Earth\u2019s temperature gradient flattens, the Rossby waves tend to bend, resulting in a curvy jet stream that is more likely to get \u201cstuck,\u201d trapping weather systems in place and creating what Mann calls \u201chuge heat domes.\u201d\" ([source](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/climate-crisis-goodell-survive-extreme-heat-875198/)\n* Thermokarst - hummocky permafrost that's irregularly melting ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/world/europe/russia-siberia-yakutia-permafrost-global-warming.html))\n* AMOC, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, correction it is NOT the same as the 'gulf stream' ([link](https://twitter.com/kaitlinnaughten/status/1215192825488384000) (?)\n\n**Fairness** terms:\n\n* Climate apartheid, \"in which the rich would \u201cpay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.\u201d **The scale of this climate emergency very much depends on the level of effort the global community puts into mitigation.**\" ([source](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-poverty-and-human-rights-an-emergency-without-precedent-120396]))\n\n* urban heat island ([*](https://twitter.com/nytclimate/status/1159796519949742083)) has a social-justice dimension, as it varies by neighborhood (\"new research shows that temperatures on a scorching summer day can vary as much as 20 degrees (F) across different parts of the same city\")\n\n* Climate justice means that those who didn't cause the problem shouldn't be the ones bearing the heaviest burden.   This entails, 1, Intergenerational justice -  which means staying within our global CO2 emissions budget.  And socioeconomic justice - we need to allocate that emissions budget fairly, by country (as is tried [in here](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2019/08/how-much-co2-your-country-can-still-emit-in-three-simple-steps/)), and also to craft climate solutions that leave marginalized communities in our own countries better off.  A possible problem with the 'climate justice' lens, is that it could morph into spending $$ for low-effectiveness measures, & that redirection of funds would reduce effectiveness of GHG-cutting investment, so that benefits to today's marginalized community come at the expense of the future - both of their community&descendants, and of the rest of humanity.  GHG-cutting effectiveness should be front&center, to the extent that it's politically possible, if we aim for climate justice for future (including older-than-now) stakeholders.\n\n* a Climate Marshall Plan, aka Green Marshall Plan ([example](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-just-added-a-green-marshall-plan-to-her-long-list-of-proposals/)) - The original Marshall Plan was what the U.S. did after WW2, we extended much aid to the war-torn countries for postwar reconstruction.

Mitigation (aka decarbonize) means Prevention, cutting [our emissions of] atmospheric GHGs, vs. Adaptation which means coping with, aka preparing for,  the consequences of our not having mitigated enough.   There's confusion being created, to blur this distinction.  (Adapting to climate change would cost *much much much* more (and ultimately fail, [examples](https://grist.org/article/who-will-pay-for-the-huge-costs-of-holding-back-rising-seas/)) than mitigation ([source](https://thinkprogress.org/real-adaptation-is-as-politically-tough-as-mitigation-but-much-more-expensive-and-less-effective-at-72d5f208dbf4/)), and it only helps locally, it doesn't help globally.  (And if you \"adapt\" by building a 3 foot sea wall, but sea level then rises 4 feet, that's doubly costly.)  A term I've seen that (I assume) means Adaptation (but doesn't say it outright, so, obscures the fact that it's only coping with the problem, not trying to prevent it)  is '**climate resilience**'.  Another, that seems more clear to me, is **ruggedizing** (which makes good sense for non-giant projects, i.e. don't do this: \"(Ironically, new, energy-efficient buildings are tightly sealed, making them dangerous heat traps.)\"([link](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/climate-crisis-goodell-survive-extreme-heat-875198/)).  (Also: any time you're tempted to say \"mitigate the effects of\", the clearer (and usually much better) term is \"**adapt to**\".)\n* Carbon budget, or more clearly **\"CO2 emissions budget\"** - the sum total (or total remaining when it was calculated) CO2 emissions we can put out, from burning fossil fuels, that's thought to keep the GHG-induced rise in temperature below a specified target \"safe\" increase.  *(if we just refer to it as 'carbon budget' it can create confusion, as the  'CO2' number is ~4x larger than the  equivalent 'Carbon' number.)*\n* HVDC - \"[electrical power grid] transmission lines: Alternating current (AC) lines are generally used for shorter distances.

Likewise a bad choice of wording (likewise a euphemism for Adapt) is if people say \"mitigating the impact of climate change\" or \"mitigating the risks\" when they mean just \"preparing for\" - it confuses the listener by blurring the distinction between climate mitigation(preventing) and climate adaptation(locally coping with).

If you are merely lowering emissions (turning down the \"faucet\" in the metaphorical bathtub), the CO2 concentration (water level in the tub) is likely still going up, the climate problem is still getting worse.

Presently, since you're refreshed with the most ideal approach to upgrade your assembling and creation handle, it ends up plainly fundamental for you to know the diverse instruments and strategies utilized inside Lean Manufacturing and know how to utilize them and where. Along these lines, how about we jump into the 6 most-utilized and essential, yet viable, apparatuses and systems you have to know. \n\n1.\t5S \n\n5S guarantees that an assembling or generation unit encounters institutionalization all through its work process, at all levels of the procedure. With standard operational practices close by, it ends up plainly less demanding for work to continue in a productive, safe, and repeatable way. Along these lines emphases can happen at higher speed, therefore, advancing larger amounts of generation. \nThese 5 stages are named in Japanese and are transliterated in English to shape 5 \"S\" terms. They are as per the following: \n\u2022\t5S Seiri \u2013 or, Sort, is the initial step of the 5S and includes sorting of the all the wreckage and mess inside the working environment while keeping just the critical and amazingly valuable things inside the work territory. \n\u2022\t5S Seiton \u2013 or, Straighten, is the following stride that manages the way toward orchestrating the cleaned up things in an effective way in order to be utilized utilizing the standards of ergonomics. This progression guarantees that each and every thing has its place and those things backpedal to their place. \n\u2022\t5S Seiso \u2013 or, Sweep, is the progression that includes an intensive cleaning of the work zone, the apparatuses to be utilized, every one of the frameworks, machines and gear to be utilized as a part of the assembling unit of the organization. This will guarantee that all the contraption utilized amid creation and gathering are on a par with new to take out any non-congruity that may emerge because of specialized challenges. \n\u2022\t5S Seiketsu \u2013 or, Standardize, guarantees that whatever work was directed in the initial 3 stages are currently institutionalized in like manner. This works in the basic benchmarks and how we have to function among the group. Institutionalization is a key part inside Lean Manufacturing, consequently, this turns into a vital stage. \n\u2022\t5S Shitsuke \u2013 or, Sustain, is the last stage that guarantees that the organization keeps up to the norms clung and adjusted to. This stage includes housekeeping and reviewing of the procedures and devices and gear. It is amid this phase the work routine turns into a culture. \n \n\n2.\tCellular Manufacturing \n\nThe idea of cell assembling expands the diverse blend of items onto a solitary assembling unit, while managing least waste. Setting off to the fundamentals of this procedure, we have to comprehend what a cell is. A cell can comprises of work regions/work stations and gear orchestrated in a reasonable way in order to encourage smooth operation of the work process. This would mean the smooth handling of the materials and components through a procedure. This cell even brags of prepared administrators who are met all requirements to work inside it. \n \nCell fabricating extremely well relies on upon the course of action of the considerable number of segments inside a work zone underway and can prompt extraordinary favorable circumstances when actualized effectively. A rule inside cell assembling is that of one-piece stream. This idea guarantees that the item travels through the creation procedure in one single unit at any given moment with no unclear or sudden intrusions. Indeed, even the pace set to the procedure would be the one characterized and slated by the client's needs and request rate. \nCell fabricating addresses the issue of taking into account the various product offerings required by clients. This strategy bunches comparable items together in order to process them in a similar arrangement and on a similar hardware. \n\n3.\tContinuous Improvement \n\nRemaining consistent with its name, Continuous Improvement is a philosophy inside Lean Manufacturing that promoters the accompanying of formal practices or a casual arrangement of principles and rules. More than a system, the state of mind of continually needing to enhance is what is impacted through this instrument. Nonstop Improvement, frequently known as Rapid Improvement, streamlines every one of the work processes that are conveyed inside the generation condition. This advances effective work processes, and productive work processes help in sparing time, cost, and assets. Consequently, this satisfies the primary idea driving Lean Manufacturing. Each assignment is embraced with a view to constantly enhance with time and every asset working towards change of administrations, items, or procedures are appropriately prepared and tweaked for utilize. \n \nConstant Improvement takes after the procedure quality cycle, called the Deming Cycle, or PDCA cycle, which includes 4 stages that the item or process needs to experience. They are as per the following: \n\u2022\tPlan \u2013 In this stage an open door for change is distinguished and the arranging is done to realize this change inside the framework. \n\u2022\tDo \u2013 Once the arranging is finished and checked, the arrangement is then executed for the change to be actualized inside the framework. \n\u2022\tCheck \u2013 In this stage, information is gathered and seen to check the accomplishment of the change, which was executed. The outcomes are broke down with a view to decide if the change achieved was fruitful. \n\u2022\tAct \u2013 Once the change is resolved to be effective, the arrangement is actualized on a substantially more extensive scale and ceaseless evaluation happens. Once more, the check stage is trailed extensive scale usage. \n\n4.\tJidoka \n\nIn Japanese, the instituted in term \"Jidoka\" can be characterizes as \"mechanization with human intercession\" in forging or other manufacturing companies. This term picked up significance amid the nineteenth century when the programmed, self-fueled linger was put without hesitation by Sakichi Toyoda, organizer of the Toyota gatherings of organizations. This programmed linger would stop in the event that it recognized a break in the string amid the way toward approaching. The administrator taking care of the linger would then intercede and settle the string before continuing the capacity. \n \nThis would imply that each time a breakage was recognized, the generation procedure would briefly end, till it's settled. Thusly no faulty item was even created, guaranteeing 100% quality to clients. Additionally, it took just a solitary administrator to deal with this whole operation which was basically practical\u2014change in efficiency of the procedure. In short the procedure put into successful every one of the standards and methods of insight of Lean Manufacturing and the procedure looks something like this: \nFramework identifies variation from the norm and conveys this to the fundamental framework \n\u21b3 Detection of deviation from the typical work process \n\u21b3 Production stops \t\n\u21b3 Operator/administrator/chief checks for the issue and resolves the issue \n\u21b3 All progressions made are consolidated to reflect in the standard work process \nAlong these lines you can bolster in every one of the imperfections and anomalies and when a work process veers off from this institutionalized stream, the framework can promptly tell you into request to redress and encourage the following irregularity in. \n\n5.\tTotal Productive Maintenance \n\nMachine downtime is a genuine worry on a generation line and can bring about hindering issues if the issue isn't settled on time. Unwavering quality on the machines and hardware on the assembling line is one worry that is tended to inside Lean Manufacturing, with the assistance of the device, Total Productive Maintenance. Setting up a Total Productive Maintenance program turns into a need in a Lean Manufacturing condition. \n \nThe Total Productive Maintenance program is basically comprised of 3 segments, which support the working of the creation/fabricating line. They are as per the following: \n\u2022\tPreventive Maintenance \u2013 These are consistently arranged and executed upkeep exercises and not minor arbitrary checks directed by the laborers. Here, the group is relied upon to perform occasional and finish gear upkeep for every one of the machines to check for any irregularities in the working. This will guarantee that sudden breakdowns don't happen and the throughput for every hardware is expanded. \n\u2022\tCorrective Maintenance \u2013 This sort of support spins around settling on the choice of whether there is a requirement for settling or obtaining new hardware out and out. It bodes well for a few machines that are encountering successive breakdowns to be analyzed and totally traded for further loss of cash and asset or even quality. \n\u2022\tMaintenance Prevention \u2013 This segment guarantees that the machines bought are the correct ones. A machine that is difficult to keep up will just purpose more inconvenience and loss of speculation for the association. Specialists will think that its hard to constantly look after it, bringing about genuine misfortune.\n \n6.\tTotal Quality Management \nAn essential Lean die Manufacturing method, Total Quality Management is a persistent quality program went for achieving collaboration among divisions, to meet up and guarantee an independent work process, yielding ideal nature of items. \n\u2022\tEmployee association and preparing \n\u2022\tProblem-understanding groups \t\n\u2022\tStatistical techniques \n\u2022\tProcess and not individuals \n\u2022\tFocus on long haul objectives \n\u2022\tQuality being characterized by the necessities of the clients \n\u2022\tDirect association of the top administration being basic to realize change and increment in steps taken towards quality \n\u2022\tQuality augmentation being a persistent exertion and one that should be proceeded as a long haul arrange \n\u2022\tImprovement in work prepare and the upkeep of the generation line \n\u2022\tSystematic examination after necessity social affair is fundamental \n\u2022\tRequirement social event ought to occur with every division included and every one of the workers inside those office.\n \n\nAbout Author:\n\nK.K.

He didnt even speak to me about it. We had so many discussions about moving in together, getting married and then he goes and purchases a truck 2k more than his yearly salary. If youre asking how can a truck be 87k, thats the price you get when you put every addition you want on it. He showed me the truck expecting me to be excited and i was livid. When he bought this truck, we were only a month from moving in together. We got into a bad argument where he told me it was his money and he could do whatever he wanted with it.\n\nSo i said fine and i told him im not comfortable moving in with him anymore. I asked my landlord if my apartment was still avaliable and if i could renew my lease and they said yes. Now my bf is saying he cant afford his place and his truck. I dont feel bad. You should have thought of that before buying something so expensive without talking to your gf of 2 years.\n\nI have had some of his friends' gf reach out to me and say i should support him and one even say that im not loyal and this shows i wouldnt support him if we were married since i run away when finances get bad. Thats bullshit. He didnt lose his job or get hurt. He bought an expensive item without discussing it. I have been trying to get him to return the truck because its already affecting his finances badly. He has only had this truck for 2 weeks and he is worried that in the next month or two, he wont be able to cover all the expenses he usually has.\n\nThis past weekend, we had another argument and i think our relationship is going to end. Im not helping him pay for this truck and im not moving in with him. I have asked for a break and will be thinking about what to do.\n\nEdit: i appreciate the different opinions everyone has given me. I have alot to think about. To answer two questions, no he doesnt need the truck. He works from home and if he has to check in at work, he has an office. Also, his friends and their girlfriends know about this issue because he asked for their views when we went to a get together last week. Only 2 gfs reached out to me to tell me i wasnt being supportive. The others have minded their business.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**_A-Q:** Good job recognizing a bad situation when you see one.\n\nThis dude fully expected you to supplement his lifestyle after moving in together. \n\nAll his money would have gone to paying that truck, leaving you stuck with the lion\u2019s share of the bills.\nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s panicking now.\n\nStay in your own apartment OP.\n\n**littlemissmoxie:** Yeah no. You were right to put yourself first. He\u2019s going to end up drowning in debt. Least you won\u2019t be there to see it.\n\nWould imagine he though he could make you take the majority of rent and household expenses while he just put money in his truck\n\n**shame-the-devil:** The minute he was expecting you to help finance his life, it ceased to be \u201chis money\u201d. You absolutely did the right thing, that man was going to use you to pay for his expensive ass truck. Ask your friends gf\u2019s if they want to give up their life to finance his mistakes, cause you sure as hell won\u2019t. And shouldn\u2019t! It\u2019ll only get worse if you enable him.\n\nHe\u2019d be coming home with a Ferrari next.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update: I broke up with my ex that got the 87k truck which i found out was actually 95k.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/NtiaFIfRHw) **March 25, 2024**\n\nYea, so i broke up with him mainly because i realized we arent financially compatible. Before i go into what happened, i do want to say something. I understand we werent married but we were both moving together into a new place and had several discussions about this move and our plans for the future, including marriage. For the people private messaging me saying its his money and he can do whatever he wants or, youre only two years into a relationship, youre not a wife. I know that and i have never asked what is in his bank account or told him what to do financially. I'm aware it is his money but i also know his financial situation and he was making decisions without my input that, if we were to stay together, would not only affect him but also our relationship and our financial situation for years to come. I will die on this hill: this is not ok and if it's ok for you, that's fine but for me, if we make a financial plan and you make a huge decision without me, i wont be ok with it and that's a big reason why i backed out of moving into a new apartment with him. I would have never made a decision like this without his input at all.\n\nThe main reason why we decided to move in together was to take the next step in our relationship but also to pay down our debts. I now have 22k debt from student loans and a car. When i met him though it was around 60k and i was bascially living on credit cards. Within the first couple of months of us dating, i saw how hard he worked and with a salary at 85k, he was making huge process in paying off his loans and credit cards.\n\nOn my end, at the time, I was only making 50k. I honestly saw his work ethic and was like wow and got serious about my debt. I got a second parttime job where i was making 32k a year, bringing my salary to 82k. I did that so that i could pay off my debts faster but also so that we could be on equal footing when we moved in together and he didnt have to pay significantly more in living expenses than me when he had more debt. We did a complete budget months before we moved in together and realized that we would each have 700 dollars extra a month to put towards our own individual budgets.\n\nThis is why the purchase of this truck was so surprising to me. We had planned this move for months. We had a budget and he destroyed that plan with the truck. If he wanted a new car, there are plenty of cars he could have gotten that would have fit into the 700 monthly surplus he had. Anyway for the past few days before we broke up, he tried to show me that this truck was a good financial purchase and we could still move in together. He told me that he had actually budgeted for this and could show me how he could afford this. I wanted to hear him out so i went to his place and he had 2 budgets.\n\nHe said he had been thinking of getting this truck for some time and he had worked out a budget beforehand. He showed me the first budget and after his truck, insurance, expenses, and his debts he was left with 115 dollars for the month. I noticed with the first budget, he didnt include groceries, his hobbies, going out or even gas for his car. I asked him how 115 dollars was enough to live off of for an entire month? I asked him how he could afford all of this and his truck and if he planned to give up some things. He said no he didnt plan to give up anything and that he could make everything work in his budget. I asked him what if he had an emergency or needed gas for his truck and he just kept saying he would work it out without explaining how.\n\nAfter i saw the first budget, i asked to see the documents for the car and thats how i found out the truck price was 95k total after taxes, registration and fees. He traded in his reliable 2003 toyota and all his savings to get a loan at 14 percent for 72 months. His monthly payment is now 1966 and insurance is 573. He also still has student loans which are significant. I kept telling him 115 dollars left over monthly wasnt enough.\n\nThat's when he showed me his second budget which had a combined higher monthly income. I asked him if he was getting a second job and he said due to his first job relying on him to be on call, he couldnt. I asked where the income was coming from and this man said, well you're getting a raise soon. I froze because i had mentioned this raise once months ago. My first job is my career job and i work in a field where when you hit certain milestones, you get a pay bump. In september, if my raise is approved, i will go from 50k to 80k, and with my second job, my total yearly income will be 112k. But getting the raise isnt a guarantee. You have to meet certain criteria and if you dont, you have to wait 3 months before trying again.\n\nWhen he said that, i was quiet and then I said: so you planned a budget that included additional income that i wouldnt get for at least 6 months and income that i might not even get in september. He said when i got my raise, the ratio of what he would pay would decrease and he would have more disposable income. I asked him why it was ok for him to plan budgets with my income but yet i had no say in how he spent his. He couldnt answer that. I told him i had no issue with paying more bills if i got a raise but the fact that he banked on that, didnt discuss it, and now expects me to be ok with this is ridiculous. I also said theres no way i wouldnt be paying more with the first budget because he wouldnt have been able to survive on 115 dollars. I told him he didnt communicate and this is on him because he made huge financial plans without discussing anything. Finally i told him i would never have done any of this without going to him first because i thought we were a team that was building something.\n\nI ended things the next day and he has been trying to reach out but im not interested. He has financially crippled himself with this truck. If with my income now, he could barely make it, he sure isnt making it on his own. I really hope that things work out for him and he is able to keep his truck and recover but im not paying the consequences for such a massive financial mistake that is going to hugely affect him for years to come. If i were to stay, this financial decision affects me as well and would continue to affect both of us for years. Again this is different from becoming ill or losing a job. He chose this and refuses to budge and fix it. I now realize we are not financially compatible and thats ok and i wish him the best.\n\n**Relevant Comment**\n\n**is_a_waterbottle_All** I have to ask is, how are you handling this with so much grace? I would be PISSED if my ex who I was so emotionally invested in, pulled this on me. It\u2019s not just that he made an irresponsible decision, it\u2019s the fact that he thought he could leech off you and your money to pay it, and somehow blindside you to get away with that. You don\u2019t badmouth him a single time and did the right thing immediately (break up), and have already accepted that you both are incompatible. I\u2019m in awe of how decisive and yet non-aggressive you were, I wish I could be that way\ud83e\udd72\n\n> **OOP:** To answer your question about why i'm not bad mouthing him, its because i'm sad. I'm sad about what he did to himself and that i had to leave because he isnt seeing how bad this is is. Im sad that just a few months ago, i was planning us living together and a life and now thats gone. Most of all, im sad for him. He was doing so well and he rubbed off on me immensely in terms of paying off debt and watching your spending. Im sad that he threw away all his hard work. Dumping on him even more isnt worth it because when he realizes this mistake, it will be so bad for him. I dont see a point to do it but im not judging anyone who would in these circumstances.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Ubergeek2001:** You are very smart. I have a wife like you and we are going to retire comfortably because of that.\n\n**TurtleDive1234:** I. AM. SO. PROUD. OF. YOU!!!\n\nI really wish more young women were as firm in their boundaries and as wise about finances as you are.\n\nMind you, this doesn\u2019t make him a bad person, but it does give you an insight into what the future would be like with him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n------------------------------\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g0djwg/update_i_posted_a_few_months_ago_about_ending_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): **October 10, 2024**\n\nHi, everyone. So I posted a few months about a situation I was dealing with my ex and him buying a car without telling me. I really doubted myself when I first made my first post because I had received such strong negative reactions from other people about me wanting to back out of the move. I appreciate the comments I got not only on the posts but through the messages as well. It really helped solidify, for me that these feelings I had about the situation shouldn't be ignored. So thank you guys for responding because it saved me financially.\n\nLooking back at the situation now months later, I can see that I was being set up to be financially abused. When I broke up with my ex, i thought that we were financially incompatible and that unfortunately it took this large purchase happening to see it. But I can see now, that's not the case. My ex made a plan in his head and what made sense to him was for me to pay most of the expenses and he thought this was okay and that I should be okay with it too.\n\nEven though I can see the reality of what he was trying to do, I can't hate my ex because he helped start me on this path of looking at my finances. I remember when we first started dating and I went to pay for an item I was getting and my card declined and without batting an eye, even though it was a little embarrassing, I took out another card and paid. I was used to this happening every once in a while, because I was literally living paycheck up to paycheck. I'm not putting down anyone where that's the case. But in my situation then, I was living way above my means. I would justify every single want and get it and I thought because I was making minimum payments and on time, i wasn't as bad as the next person.\n\nWhen the situation with my card happened, after we got back to my ex's car, he kindly asked if this type of thing happens all the time and I told him sometimes and he basically gave me advice. He did not try to force me to stop spending. He asked me to track my purchases and recommended a few apps. The first 2 months that we were seeing each other, he would encourage me every other day or every once in a while, to just track what I spent, to shop like I usually did, but to track everything. Being able to see how much I was spending, especially when I broke it down into categories was astounding. There was one month I spent sixty eight dollars on bagels. It wasn't for work. It wasn't for other people. It was me stopping at a bagel place every morning and getting a bagel. I would sometimes get variations, which is why the bagels cost so much.\n\nOnce I realized how much I was spending on stupid things, my ex helped me make a plan that would work for me and that plan has continued to consistently work. I have added to it and changed things or tweaked things as my financial status has continued to improve, and so far, so good. This is why I don't have any bad feelings about my ex. He never pushed for me to pay my bills in front of him. He never saw credit card statements on apps, nothing. He only kept encouraging me to look at my finances and fix them. He helped give me the foundation to start to manage my finances and I thought in my head that we were on the same page. And because he was such a stickler for finances and he was so frugal, that is why this truck purchase was such a surprise to me. It was unplanned, not discussed, was a large amount of money and, just knowing the general view of how much debt he had, I know without a doubt that there was no way he could afford this truck.\n\nI'm not trying to paint my ex as a saint. I am explaining why he had such a positive impact on me financially. So when the truck purchase happened, and he refused to budge, I honestly was shocked and seeing how bad this situation was, i had to walk away.\n\nIt's been about 6 months since everything's happened and I'm doing very well. I recently paid off my student loans last month. I now only have my car left so a few grand left to pay. I also have a small savings. Because of that, i have changed the focus and im putting the majority of my income now towards my car. I'm not rich by any means, but i'm definitely living within my means and i'm okay with that.\n\nThe last two things I am updating on are my raise and my ex's truck. I had a few people message me about the raise and unfortunately I did not get it due to a big mistake i made on a project. Once I realized the mistake, i knew that it would jeopardize things for my raise because I had made the mistake so close to my evaluation and I didn't get the raise. But I fixed the mistake, and when I get reevaluated after three months, i am hopeful I get it this time. Losing the possibility of the raise made me realize even more that I had made the right decision because I would be so screwed right now if I hadn't ended my relationship.\n\nWith my ex, we have spoken once and that is when we broke up. I cut communication completely, because he was still trying to fix things without addressing the truck and the fact that he was keeping it. I know from a person close to him that actually four months after we broke up, he did a voluntary repossession. I also know the truck is gone, because he deleted all the pictures he had of it. I was actually relieved to hear that for him because he can hopefully start to fix the situation he got himself in. I really do want the best for my ex and I don't know the thought process that led to him getting this truck, or what could have influenced him, but hopefully he can get back to where he was and make more improvements. \n\nThe relationship is finished and there is no hope of rekindling anything. Even though he returned the truck, I could never go back to him because the trust is gone. It wasn't only the money. It was also him making such a vital decision without me, expecting me to go along with it, and then vilifying me when I had viable concerns. I can't move past that. Yes, money isn't everything, but I can't stop thinking about what my life would be like now had I stayed. \n\nMy student loans would not be paid off. We would both be broke. We would both be in worse off financial positions. All of these things would have affected the relationship negatively, which would have made it unhealthy. Im glad we broke up and I have forgiven him for what he tried to do to me. I stand and I will continue to stand by the view that finances are a breakable offense, especially when your partner isn't listening to you and does something that will affect both of you. If you don't agree that's fine, but these last few months have proved that to me.\n\nSo that's my longish update, and again, I really want to say thank you guys for responding to my first post. I honestly was leaning towards staying with him and not moving in, and I think in the long run, I would have been financially devastated and taken advantage of right now and because of the different opinions i read, It made me realize how bad not only the situation was, but also how bad it could get, so thanks.\n\nA very, very, very, very small, humble brag. I posted my paid in full student loan email on my profile, so if you want to see that you can click that post but you don't have to. Sorry, i'm just so proud of that fact. Ok bye :).\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Congrats! Very adult of you. What apps did you use?\n\n> **OOP:** Hi thank you for the comment. I used a basic spending tracker app on my phone. I then had an excel spreadsheet, which I update once a week to keep track of expenses. Finally, I used a budget binder with envelopes for cash and I use this primarily for my wants. It worked for me to just pay cash for them until I got enough self control to not splurge. It was trial and error trying to figure out what worked for me, but i eventually did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**", "Toyota boasts new battery technology with 745-mile range and 10-minute charging time \u2014 here\u2019s how it may impact mass EV adoption ", "Toyota SUV ads banned for condoning driving \u2018with no regard for environmental impact\u2019 ", "[Final Update] - I posted a few months ago about ending my relationship with my ex who bought an 87K truck without telling me.

Also, his friends and their girlfriends know about this issue because he asked for their views when we went to a get together last week. Only 2 gfs reached out to me to tell me i wasn't being supportive. The others have minded their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\_A-Q**\n\n*Good job recognizing a bad situation when you see one. This dude fully expected you to supplement his lifestyle after moving in together. All his money would have gone to paying that truck, leaving you stuck with the lion\u2019s share of the bills. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s panicking now. Stay in your own apartment OP.*\n\n**nobodynocrime**\n\n*And he had the audacity to say that it was his money and he could do what he wanted with it knowing full well he would have to live out of the truck if OP didn't supplement for him. Really tells you what he thinks about OP's money (that its his money too). Entitled ass. I would dump him so hard.*\n\n**xasdfxx**\n\n*Reeks of my money is mine but your money is ours. Dump any moron who spends $1700 a month on a 5 year loan for a toy while being unable to make rent.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Judgement - NTA\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update - 6 days later**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYea, so i broke up with him mainly because i realized we aren't financially compatible. Before i go into what happened, i do want to say something. I understand we weren't married but we were both moving together into a new place and had several discussions about this move and our plans for the future, including marriage. For the people private messaging me saying its his money and he can do whatever he wants or, you're only two years into a relationship, you're not a wife.\n\nI know that and i have never asked what is in his bank account or told him what to do financially. I'm aware it is his money but i also know his financial situation and he was making decisions without my input that, if we were to stay together, would not only affect him but also our relationship and our financial situation for years to come. I will die on this hill: this is not ok and if it's ok for you, that's fine but for me, if we make a financial plan and you make a huge decision without me, i wont be ok with it and that's a big reason why i backed out of moving into a new apartment with him. I would have never made a decision like this without his input at all.\n\nThe main reason why we decided to move in together was to take the next step in our relationship but also to pay down our debts. I now have 22k debt from student loans and a car. When i met him though it was around 60k and i was basically living on credit cards. Within the first couple of months of us dating, i saw how hard he worked and with a salary at 85k, he was making huge process in paying off his loans and credit cards.\n\nOn my end, at the time, I was only making 50k. I honestly saw his work ethic and was like wow and got serious about my debt. I got a second parttime job where i was making 32k a year, bringing my salary to 82k. I did that so that i could pay off my debts faster but also so that we could be on equal footing when we moved in together and he didn't have to pay significantly more in living expenses than me when he had more debt. We did a complete budget months before we moved in together and realized that we would each have 700 dollars extra a month to put towards our own individual budgets.\n\nThis is why the purchase of this truck was so surprising to me. We had planned this move for months. We had a budget and he destroyed that plan with the truck. If he wanted a new car, there are plenty of cars he could have gotten that would have fit into the 700 monthly surplus he had. Anyway for the past few days before we broke up, he tried to show me that this truck was a good financial purchase and we could still move in together. He told me that he had actually budgeted for this and could show me how he could afford this. I wanted to hear him out so i went to his place and he had 2 budgets.\n\nHe said he had been thinking of getting this truck for some time and he had worked out a budget beforehand. He showed me the first budget and after his truck, insurance, expenses, and his debts he was left with 115 dollars for the month. I noticed with the first budget, he didn't include groceries, his hobbies, going out or even gas for his car. I asked him how 115 dollars was enough to live off of for an entire month?\n\nI asked him how he could afford all of this and his truck and if he planned to give up some things. He said no he didn't plan to give up anything and that he could make everything work in his budget. I asked him what if he had an emergency or needed gas for his truck and he just kept saying he would work it out without explaining how.\n\nAfter i saw the first budget, i asked to see the documents for the car and that's how i found out the truck price was 95k total after taxes, registration and fees. He traded in his reliable 2003 Toyota and all his savings to get a loan at 14 percent for 72 months. His monthly payment is now 1966 and insurance is 573. He also still has student loans which are significant. I kept telling him 115 dollars left over monthly wasn't enough.\n\nThat's when he showed me his second budget which had a combined higher monthly income. I asked him if he was getting a second job and he said due to his job relying on him to be on call, he couldn't. I asked where the income was coming from and this man said, well you're getting a raise soon. I froze because i had mentioned this raise once months ago.\n\nMy first job is my career job and i work in a field where when you hit certain milestones, you get a pay bump. In September, if my raise is approved, i will go from 50k to 80k, and with my second job, my total yearly income will be 112k. But getting the raise isnt a guarantee. You have to meet certain criteria and if you dont, you have to wait 3 months before trying again.\n\nWhen he said that, i was quiet and then I said: so you planned a budget that included additional income that i wouldn't get for at least 6 months and income that i might not even get in September. He said when i got my raise, the ratio of what he would pay would decrease and he would have more disposable income. I asked him why it was ok for him to plan budgets with my income but yet i had no say in how he spent his.\n\nHe couldn't answer that. I told him i had no issue with paying more bills if i got a raise but the fact that he banked on that, didn't discuss it, and now expects me to be ok with this is ridiculous. I also said there's no way i wouldn't be paying more with the first budget because he wouldn't have been able to survive on 115 dollars. I told him he didn't communicate and this is on him because he made huge financial plans without discussing anything. Finally i told him i would never have done any of this without going to him first because i thought we were a team that was building something.\n\nI ended things the next day and he has been trying to reach out but I'm not interested. He has financially crippled himself with this truck. If with my income now, he could barely make it, he sure isn't making it on his own. I really hope that things work out for him and he is able to keep his truck and recover but I'm not paying the consequences for such a massive financial mistake that is going to hugely affect him for years to come.\n\nIf i were to stay, this financial decision affects me as well and would continue to affect both of us for years. Again this is different from becoming ill or losing a job. He chose this and refuses to budge and fix it. I now realize we are not financially compatible and thats ok and i wish him the best.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for all the support. I don't hate my ex and i really hope he's able to recover from this. It was such a learning lesson for me in how one mistake can ruin you financially. It has made me even more cautious but also determined to keep working towards a better financial future for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ubergeek2001**\n\n*You are very smart.

I would be PISSED if my ex who I was so emotionally invested in, pulled this on me. It\u2019s not just that he made an irresponsible decision, it\u2019s the fact that he thought he could leech off you and your money to pay it, and somehow blindside you to get away with that. You don\u2019t badmouth him a single time and did the right thing immediately (break up), and have already accepted that you both are incompatible. I\u2019m in awe of how decisive and yet non-aggressive you were, I wish I could be that way*\n\n>OOP: To answer your question about why I'm not bad mouthing him, its because I'm sad. I'm sad about what he did to himself and that i had to leave because he isn't seeing how bad this is is. I'm sad that just a few months ago, i was planning us living together and a life and now that's gone.  \n>  \n>Most of all, I'm sad for him. He was doing so well and he rubbed off on me immensely in terms of paying off debt and watching your spending. I'm sad that he threw away all his hard work. Dumping on him even more isn't worth it because when he realizes this mistake, it will be so bad for him. I dont see a point to do it but im not judging anyone who would in these circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*New Update - 7 months later\\*\\***\n\n**Update: I posted a few months ago about ending my relationship with my ex who bought an 87K truck without telling me.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing ahead with that decision means that I paid off my student loans this past month. He also returned the truck. Hi, everyone. So I posted a few months about a situation I was dealing with my ex and him buying a car without telling me. I really doubted myself when I first made my first post because I had received such strong negative reactions from other people about me wanting to back out of the move. I appreciate the comments I got not only on the posts but through the messages as well. It really helped solidify, for me that these feelings I had about the situation shouldn't be ignored. So thank you guys for responding because it saved me financially.\n\nLooking back at the situation now months later, I can see that I was being set up to be financially abused. When I broke up with my ex, i thought that we were financially incompatible and that unfortunately it took this large purchase happening to see it. But I can see now, that's not the case. My ex made a plan in his head and what made sense to him was for me to pay most of the expenses and he thought this was okay and that I should be okay with it too.\n\nEven though I can see the reality of what he was trying to do, I can't hate my ex because he helped start me on this path of looking at my finances. I remember when we first started dating and I went to pay for an item I was getting and my card declined and without batting an eye, even though it was a little embarrassing, I took out another card and paid. I was used to this happening every once in a while, because I was literally living paycheck up to paycheck. I'm not putting down anyone where that's the case. But in my situation then, I was living way above my means. I would justify every single want and get it and I thought because I was making minimum payments and on time, i wasn't as bad as the next person.\n\nWhen the situation with my card happened, after we got back to my ex's car, he kindly asked if this type of thing happens all the time and I told him sometimes and he basically gave me advice. He did not try to force me to stop spending. He asked me to track my purchases and recommended a few apps. The first 2 months that we were seeing each other, he would encourage me every other day or every once in a while, to just track what I spent, to shop like I usually did, but to track everything. Being able to see how much I was spending, especially when I broke it down into categories was astounding. There was one month I spent sixty eight dollars on bagels. It wasn't for work. It wasn't for other people. It was me stopping at a bagel place every morning and getting a bagel. I would sometimes get variations, which is why the bagels cost so much.\n\nOnce I realized how much I was spending on stupid things, my ex helped me make a plan that would work for me and that plan has continued to consistently work. I have added to it and changed things or tweaked things as my financial status has continued to improve, and so far, so good. This is why I don't have any bad feelings about my ex. He never pushed for me to pay my bills in front of him. He never saw credit card statements on apps, nothing. He only kept encouraging me to look at my finances and fix them. He helped give me the foundation to start to manage my finances and I thought in my head that we were on the same page. And because he was such a stickler for finances and he was so frugal, that is why this truck purchase was such a surprise to me. It was unplanned, not discussed, was a large amount of money and, just knowing the general view of how much debt he had, I know without a doubt that there was no way he could afford this truck.\n\nI'm not trying to paint my ex as a saint. I am explaining why he had such a positive impact on me financially. So when the truck purchase happened, and he refused to budge, I honestly was shocked and seeing how bad this situation was, i had to walk away.\n\nIt's been about 6 months since everything's happened and I'm doing very well. I recently paid off my student loans last month. I now only have my car left so 12 grand left to pay. I also have a small savings. Because of that, i have changed the focus and im putting the majority of my income now towards my car. I'm not rich by any means, but i'm definitely living within my means and i'm okay with that.\n\nThe last two things I am updating on are my raise and my ex's truck. I had a few people message me about the raise and unfortunately I did not get it due to a big mistake i made on a project. Once I realized the mistake, i knew that it would jeopardize things for my raise because I had made the mistake so close to my evaluation and I didn't get the raise. But I fixed the mistake, and when I get reevaluated after three months, i am hopeful I get it this time. Losing the possibility of the raise made me realize even more that I had made the right decision because I would be so screwed right now if I hadn't ended my relationship.\n\nWith my ex, we have spoken once and that is when we broke up. I cut communication completely, because he was still trying to fix things without addressing the truck and the fact that he was keeping it. I know from a person close to him that actually four months after we broke up, he did a voluntary repossession. I also know the truck is gone, because he deleted all the pictures he had of it. I was actually relieved to hear that for him because he can hopefully start to fix the situation he got himself in. I really do want the best for my ex and I don't know the thought process that led to him getting this truck, or what could have influenced him, but hopefully he can get back to where he was and make more improvements.\n\nThe relationship is finished and there is no hope of rekindling anything. Even though he returned the truck, I could never go back to him because the trust is gone. It wasn't only the money. It was also him making such a vital decision without me, expecting me to go along with it, and then vilifying me when I had viable concerns. I can't move past that. Yes, money isn't everything, but I can't stop thinking about what my life would be like now had I stayed. My student loans would not be paid off. We would both be broke.We would both be in worse off financial positions. All of these things would have affected the relationship negatively, which would have made it unhealthy. Im glad we broke up and I have forgiven him what he tried to do to me. I stand and I will continue to stand by the view that finances are a breakable offense, especially when your partner isn't listening to you and does something that will affect both of you. If you don't agree that's fine, but these last few months have proved that to me.\n\nSo that's my longish update, and again, I really want to say thank you guys for responding to my first post. I honestly was leaning towards staying with him and not moving in, and I think in the long run, I would have been financially devastated and taken advantage right now and because of the different opinions i read, It made me realize how bad not only the situation was, but also how bad it could get, so thanks.\n\nA very, very, very, very small, humble brag. I posted my paid in full student loan email on my profile, so if you want to see that you can click that post but you don't have to. Sorry, i'm just so proud of that fact. Ok bye :).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Griffin\\_EJ**\n\n*Congratulations on paying off your loans. Glad you stuck to your decision and things working out for you!*\n\n**trvllvr**\n\n*I can tell you what motivated or was the catalyst for his decision to buy the truck. It was you mentioning your possible raise. He always wanted the truck, but learning you\u2019d could be making more he jumped the gun and purchased it in advance. He was betting on the raise, he didn\u2019t think of the possibility that you wouldn\u2019t get it. He thought it was a guarantee. Honestly, be glad he did it when he did. Could you imagine if he waited until you did move in together? Then you\u2019d be more trapped due to having signed a lease with him. He would have screwed your credit, even if you didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t help him pay for the truck having your name on the lease and him not paying his portion would affect you. He also would have guilted you into helping by paying more even if you still only made the same amount because he\u2019d be struggling. I couldn\u2019t imagine if you had gotten the raise, he\u2019d probably guilt you into keeping your second job, because then you could help him more.*\n\n*Glad you stuck to your decision. I get it\u2019s his money to do with as he wishes. However, he seemed to think as did those who sided with him that your money was his too. That he could make decisions about your money and how it was spent, but you couldn\u2019t do the same. Honestly, too, you didn\u2019t try to control his decision or his money. You were controlling what happened to your money.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I am not the OOP.

I'm at work now but will do my best to respond to all the questions/comments I can later today. \n\n\n1. Take full advantage of 401K match. When I first started my career I didn't always do this. I wasn't making a lot of money and prioritized fun over free money. Honestly I could have had just as much fun and made some better financial choices elsewhere, like not leasing a car.\n2. Invest in a Roth IRA. Once I did start putting money into a 401K I was often going past the match amount and not funding a Roth instead. If I could go back that's what I'd do. I'm not in a place where I max out my 401K and my with and I both max out Roth IRAs.\n3. Don't get new cars. I was originally going to say don't lease as that's what I did but a better rule is no new cars. One exception here is if you are fully funding your retirement and just make a boatload of money and choose to treat yourself in this way go for it. I still think it's better to get a 2 year old car than a new one even then but I'll try not to get too preachy.\n4. Buy cars you can afford with cash. I've decided that for me I now buy cars cash and don't finance them, but I understand why some people prefer to take out very low interest loans on cars. If you are going to take a loan make sure you have the full amount in cash and invest it at a higher rate of return, if it's just sitting in a bank account you are losing money. We've been conditioned for years that we all deserve shiny new things. We don't deserve them these are wants not needs.\n\n\n\nThose are my big ones. I was good with a lot of other stuff. I've never carried a balance on a credit card. I always paid my bills on time. I had an emergency fund saved up quite early in my career. The items above are where I look back and see easy room for improvement that now at 37 would have paid off quite well for me with little to no real impact on my lifestyle back then aside from driving around less fancy cars.", "Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**\r  \n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker\u2019s stock plunged.

His questioning of Subaru\u2019s mindset to choosing who he saves and who he doesn\u2019t has clearly left a lasting impression on Subaru, as during tense emotional moments in arc 8, such as his confrontation with Abel and revealing the truth about Louis to Rem had him reflect on Todd\u2019s words.

The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--> Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

I met twelve-year-old Bradford only an hour ago.\n\nNow his head is smashed in and he\u2019s lying in a pool of blood in the middle of my basement floor.\n\nThe police will be here any minute to arrest me, no doubt.\n\nThey\u2019ll gather testimony from the other three boys that were here tonight, then from the nearly one hundred other boys that have visited my basement over the past seventeen years.\n\nAlright, writing that down makes me sound like a pervert, but I\u2019m not a pervert. Let\u2019s get that out there.\n\nThis is my final confession.\n\nIt all started in the year 2002. I had just graduated with a master\u2019s in psychology and was working at Top Hat Video to pay the bills while pursuing research on Psychedelic Therapy on the side.\n\nWhile exiting the local Cinemark after seeing M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s Signs on opening night, I noticed a group of four boys gathered around the ticket booth, one of whom I recognized as a neighborhood kid, Jimmy McConkie. They had just learned that the 11:15 pm showing was sold out and were trying to figure out whose mom could pick them up. \n\nJimmy saw me and called out. \u201cHey Marcus! How\u2019s it goin?\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy, what\u2019s goin on?\u201d\n\n\u201cSigns is sold out,\u201d he said, visibly disheartened.\n\n\u201cDamn, sorry man. I just saw it,\u201d I said.\n\nHis face lit up and his friends gathered around. \u201cWell, how was it?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying,\u201d I said. \u201cSo good.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man, well, we\u2019ll have to try tomorrow,\u201d he said, turning to his friends.\n\nThey nodded in affirmation.\n\nThen I started thinking. \n\nMy latest research had been on the use of psychedelics to treat early childhood trauma. In theory, the drugs would help access a higher plane of existence, which, with the guidance of a licensed professional, could be used to gain a deeper understanding of the trauma. \n\nOf course, much of what I was studying back then is almost common knowledge in progressive psychiatric circles today. LSD, MDMA, and Psilocybin (as found in mushrooms) are used regularly in underground guided-therapy sessions nowadays, but back then, no way. In the 1960s or 70s? Sure. Early 2000s? No.\n\nOn a whim, I invited the boys over to my house. I told them I\u2019d give them a preview of Signs without spoiling too much. Since the kids still didn\u2019t have a ride home, they accepted my invitation. They packed into my Subaru Outback and I took them to my home. For all the talk about stranger danger, these twelve-year-olds were much too confident coming with me. Though, again, I had no ill intent. I never did, at any point.\n\nIt sounds so creepy writing it down like this, but a handful of willing kids was exactly what I needed to test my methods. If the combination of psychedelics and hypnosis could work for trauma, why not for fun?\n\nI served the four of them Pepsi while I got the basement ready. I set up four chairs in the middle of my unfinished basement, turned on the surround-sound speakers, and got a bell from the storage room. I ground up tablets of MDMA and fed them into the dry powder inhaler.\n\nI brought the boys down and invited them to take a seat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna set the scene for you,\u201d I said, handing them blindfolds. \u201cImagine you\u2019re on a farmhouse in the middle of rural Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nOnce their blindfolds were fastened, I started the binaural beats on the speakers. \u201cYou are surrounded by hundreds of acres of cornfield,\u201d I said and rang the bell.\n\nI took the powder inhaler to each one and instructed them to inhale on my count. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 breathe in,\u201d I\u2019d say, spraying the ground MDMA. \u201cThis will help you envision the scene a bit better,\u201d I told them.\n\nThey were giddy with excitement as I walked them through the story. I could tell when the drugs kicked in because their reactions became more animated. Once I realized my power, I\u2019ll admit I embellished the details a little bit, but the boys were having the time of their lives.\n\nAlthough I wanted to go deeper, I stuck with the story, making sure to get their permission before veering into spoiler territory. I ended on a strong note then let the high wear off before driving them home.\n\nThe boys decided, on their own volition, that they\u2019d tell their parents they saw the movie as planned and that it was fantastic. They knew it was sketchy going over to a single neighborhood man\u2019s house under the radar, so they promised each other to keep quiet.\n\nAs the months went on, that same group of four boys returned a few more times, asking me to take them on some sort of adventure. Sometimes they had specific requests\u2013I want to fly; Let\u2019s do a haunted house; How bout a creepy version of Disneyland, etc. Other times, they let me call the shots.\n\nThe process was simple enough. I played around with drug types and dosages, along with my hypnosis techniques and music. Eventually, I had formulas for every type of occasion.\n\nAs that group of four boys got older, they brought their younger brothers and other neighborhood kids as a kind of sacred rite-of-passage. \n\nIn 2007, Jimmy graduated high school. He went on to other things and I stayed in the same place, continuing my research. Eventually, I got a job teaching Psychology 101 at the community college. By that time, I had myself a group of about eight regulars aged twelve to fifteen that would come over about once a month and allow me to take them on whatever adventure they (or I) wanted. \n\nAgain, not a pervert.\n\nAfter applying blindfolds, dimming the lights, putting on music, and giving each of them a couple inhales of my special powder, I told them to imagine various scenarios. I\u2019d give only a basic level of detail and allow their drug-infused brains to fill in the gaps. I\u2019ll admit I pushed the boundaries sometimes to see what kind of reaction I\u2019d get. \n\nIt was around the year 2015 when I made my first real breakthrough. I had a group of six boys, I think. After the regular setup, I decided to do something a little different. To the best of my recollection, here\u2019s how the session went:\n\n\u201cI want you to imagine you\u2019ve arrived at an abandoned mansion in the middle of the desert. It\u2019s the biggest house you\u2019ve ever seen. Very dark, very creepy. You open the rusty gate that guards the property and walk through, kicking your feet through piles of moldy leaves. \n\n\u201cYou slip past what remains of the front door and walk in on a grand entrance. Double staircases, a giant crystal chandelier, granite floors. It smells of mildew and dust, like it hasn\u2019t been touched in years. Cobwebs cake seemingly every corner. As you step in and take in the utter beauty of this masterpiece of a mansion, you hear something\u2014the faint lull of a cello.\n\n\u201cIntrigued, you follow the sound, taking you down long, winding corridors to a two-story library. The shelves are stocked with books, but they are dusty and rotted much like everything else in the house. The faded sun makes its way through the large stained-glass windows, giving off glares of all colors. In the center of the room is a beautiful woman. She is the composite of every beautiful woman you have ever seen.\u201d\n\nEach of the boys shifted, smiles creeping on their faces. I couldn\u2019t help but smile too.\n\n\u201cThat beautiful woman is the one who\u2019s playing the cello. She plays with such fervent passion. The way it reverberates through the library sends a chill down your spine. As you stand there, watching her play carefully with seemingly her whole body, you notice that the second-floor mezzanine is beginning to fill up with people. People you know. Friends, family, acquaintances. They wear somber looks as they take their place standing above you. None of them seem to notice you standing there.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, you realize why they\u2019re there. Off to the side, behind the cellist, is an open casket. Your heart sinks as you begin to understand the situation you have walked into. You cautiously approach the mahogany casket as the cello croons in the background. You lean forward to get a closer look at the body. There, with taut white flesh, closed eyes, and caked in makeup, is your dead body.\u201d\n\nOne of the boys yelped and fell out of his chair. The others snapped out of hypnosis, ripping the blindfolds off. A couple of them had tears streaming down their faces.\n\nI turned off the music and nervously watched them compose themselves in silence. There were so many emotions in the room, I couldn\u2019t get a good read on the boys. Eventually, once things relaxed a bit, one of the boys approached me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOkay, do you need a ride? Are you okay?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine. I just\u2014\u201d he paused for a moment holding back tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been an asshole to my little brother lately. Now I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll die, or he\u2019ll die before I have a chance to make things right. I don\u2019t want things to end like this. I want him to know\u2014\u201d \n\nHe looked around to the other guys and saw that their emotions seemed to match his own. \u201cI want him to know I love him.\u201d He walked upstairs, out the front door, never to be seen again. \n\nA few of the other boys expressed something similar\u2014that there were a few people in their lives that they had been jerks to, that they had lied to, that they hadn\u2019t been nice to. They wanted to make things right.\n\nFor the first time since I had begun this endeavor, I felt good about myself. It was the first time I had dared do anything meaningful with the therapy and it seemed to be effective. These boys\u2019 lives were changed for good because of this simple session. \n\nFast forward a few years and I have had almost a hundred different boys come to do guided psychedelic therapy sessions with me. They all understood the gravity of keeping it on the down-low\u2014a point that tended to be baked into the initial invitation.\n\nTonight, however, I took things too far.\n\nRather than using the therapy as a method to help the boys explore themselves, I attempted to use it as a method to learn the secrets of the universe.\n\nJust a few hours ago, a group of four boys, two of which I had hosted before stopped by, asking if I could conduct a session. I had nothing else going on, aside from a little reading and late-night solo drinking, so I let them in. They had just come from basketball practice. \n\nThey followed me into the basement and took their seats. The two boys that had been there before\u2014Adam and Bryson\u2014explained the process to the two new boys\u2014Bradford and Trey. The two new boys seemed nervous, as most first-timers are, but they trusted their friends enough to proceed.\n\nI started the music, dimmed the lights, and instructed them to place the blindfolds on. I took another sip of whiskey then walked the inhaler around, giving each boy three puffs of my special sauce.\n\nAside from generalities, I don\u2019t usually plan these \u2018adventures\u2019 too far in advance. I suppose it was the late-night reading of Lovecraft infused with alcohol and a relentless thunderstorm that led me on tonight\u2019s particular excursion.\n\nI started the session slowly, allowing about thirty minutes for the drugs to take full effect, all while occasionally ringing the bell.\n\n\u201cYou find yourself in the middle of the woods one evening, the pink sky filtering through thick rows of pine trees. You walk carefully, mindfully through the woods, the soft padding of fallen pine needles cushioning your every step.\u201d\n\nThe boys slouched in their chairs as they fell deeper into hypnosis.\n\n\u201cAs you walk along, smelling the sweet smell of the pines, hearing the chirping crickets, you find a fallen wooden sign half-buried in the ground. You dig it out and brush it off. On it reads something quite peculiar. \u2018This way to the end of the world,\u2019 it reads. You find a tree with an old rusty nail about six feet up and determine that this must be what the sign was attached to.\n\n\u201cYou continue trekking through the woods, all while keeping an eye out for whatever *the end of the world* might be. The further you go into the forest, the darker it gets. Pretty soon, you start to feel something. You start to internalize the gravity of the situation. Although you thought the sign was silly at first, you now believe it. You become confident that you are about to discover something groundbreaking.\n\n\u201cThe chirping crickets suddenly stop. Ahead of you is a metal stairway that leads down into a wide hole\u2014about fifty feet in diameter. You edge closer to the hole and realize that the fading daylight doesn\u2019t offer you enough to see the extent of its depth.\n\n\u201cYou consider turning back, but the unwavering sense of curiosity gets the best of you and you decide to descend the stairs. You go slowly at first, testing the loadbearing of each step carefully. After about twenty stairs, you feel safe and start descending quicker. Another hundred feet down, you happen upon a heavy metal door with rusted bolts and hinges.\n\n\u201cYou push the door hard and it squeaks open revealing a man playing basketball alone in an empty arena. Each time the ball bounces, it echoes through the building and into the stairwell you occupy.\u201d\n\nSome of the boys sit upright, smirking.\n\n\u201cAfter making a long three, the man grips the basketball and turns slowly to face you. He walks to you very carefully. As he gets closer, you realize the man is huge.\u201d\n\nThe boys grip their seats.\n\n\u201cOnce he\u2019s about fifty feet away, you recognize him. It\u2019s Lebron James!\u201d\n\nThe boys laugh in excitement. One of them stands up and pumps his fist. I can\u2019t help but chuckle to myself at my spontaneity. Lebron James is probably the only current NBA player I can name.\n\n\u201cWhen he gets to the doorway, standing right in front of you, a serious look passes on his face, and he begins to speak.\u201d I clear my throat and drop my voice.\n\n\u201c\u2019I know that you think you\u2019re just having a fun time, going on a psychedelic adventure, but you have to understand something,\u2019 he says. \u2018This journey is important. Very important. What you are doing has the potential to unlock all the mysteries of the earth. You just have to keep going. Promise me you\u2019ll keep going.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of the boys swallows hard. All of them nod in agreement.\n\n\u201cThen, the ball he\u2019s holding turns to fire. He dribbles it a few times and spins it on his finger, apparently unfazed. He hands you the ball and you hold it with both hands. The flames dance around the ball without burning you. \u2018This will help light your path,\u2019 he says, then slams the door. Lebron James is gone. You continue down the stairwell, your path lit by the flaming basketball.\n\n\u201cAfter another hour of descending the stairs, you reach a second door. This one is equally heavy and rusty as the first. As you push it open, you hear the sound of waves crashing. You lean your shoulder into the door, as you did with the first one, and shove it open. Sand spills onto your feet. You look upon a beautiful endless beach of white sand bordered by blue, crashing waves on one side and lush jungle vegetation on the other. A cool, saltwater mist touches your skin.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear the ding of the bell, the sun will disappear,\u201d I said. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026\u201d I dinged the bell and waited for a moment. A couple of the boys leaned forward.\n\n\u201cYou can still hear the waves crashing and feel the ocean mist, but the world is pitch black. No stars. No moon. You can only see the few feet of sand in front of you, as illuminated by the flaming basketball. As you focus on the sound, you hear someone walking toward you. When I count to three and ding the bell, the sun will reappear, and your mother will be standing there. One\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026\u201d I dinged the bell again. The boys smiled nervously.\n\n\u201cThis woman brought you into the world, she fed you, clothed you, changed your diapers. Your mother sacrificed so much for you. You feel this. In this moment, you internalize an undying gratitude for your mother. You would do absolutely anything for her\u2014you\u2019d take a bullet for her or jump in front of a bus. Absolutely anything.\u201d\n\nI wait for a moment, allowing my words to marinate.\n\n\u201cYour mom stands in the sand about fifty feet back, looking at you with a smile. She invites you in, but you can\u2019t move\u2014you\u2019re stuck in the stairwell. As soon as you realize this, you see someone else approach. A man dressed head-to-toe in black emerges from the jungle with a machete. His identity is concealed by a leather black mask.\n\n\u201cYour mom continues to smile, unaware of the man in black approaching. You try to call out, but you can\u2019t speak. You wave your hands furiously until she pays attention. A look of fear passes over her. As she turns around to confront her attacker, the man hits her over the head, knocking her unconscious. You notice for the first time that there is a large cage in the sand behind the attacker. The man drags your unconscious mother into the cage, slams the door, and locks it. You look at her limp body sprawled out on the metal floor of the cage and are filled with rage. \n\n\u201cYou try to move again but can\u2019t. You try to scream but can\u2019t. The man in black notices you and approaches. When he is standing right in front of you, he dangles the key to the cage and laughs a deep, ugly chuckle. He then throws the key out of the door, over your head. You hear it clank down the staircase, disappearing far, far below you into the void. The man pulls his mask off revealing a horrific, warped face with gaping, bloody holes where his eyes should be. He speaks again: \u2018one more door.\u2019 The door slams shut, booming into the stairwell.\u201d\n\nOne of the boys shakes his head furiously. The others look angry. *It\u2019s working,* I thought.\n\n\u201cAs you continue descending the stairs, lit by the flaming basketball, you feel brave and confident, like you can confront whatever lies in the third and final door. You can get the keys to the cage. You can save your mother and you can find the secrets to the end of the world. You just have to keep going. You have to be\u2014\u201d\n\nThunder cracked outside, loud enough to make me jump and snap the boys out of hypnosis. They ripped their blindfolds off and stumbled to their feet, breathing heavily.\n\n\u201cOh my god, that was intense,\u201d Adam said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep going?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMan, that was enough for one night. Great trip though, I loved meeting Lebron James. That felt so real. Didn\u2019t that feel real?\u201d Trey said to the others. They nodded in agreement. \n\n\u201cDamn lightning woke you guys up,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, thanks for havin\u2019 us over Mr. Marcus,\u201d Bryson said, picking up his hat.\n\nAs they started up the stairs, I noticed that not all of them snapped out of the hypnosis. Bradford sat still, blindfold on, still gripping his chair.\n\n\u201cShould I wake him?\u201d I asked the others. This was Bradford\u2019s first session and I didn\u2019t want him to freak out when he awoke.\n\n\u201cYou guys go ahead, I\u2019ll wait for Bradford to wake up,\u201d Adam said. \n\nBryson and Trey disappeared a couple minutes later after making plans with Adam to meet up at Bradford\u2019s house when . Adam then took a seat in the corner, excited to watch the session with Bradford proceed. \n\n\u201cYou continue descending the stairs, a blast of cool air blowing past you,\u201d I said.\n\nBradford visibly shivered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your strategy?\u201d Adam whispered to me.\n\nI turned the music up, allowing Bradford a few minutes to descend the stairs.\n\nI walked over to Adam. \u201cThe key is to get each of the patients in touch with as many emotions and feelings as possible. Happy, sad, afraid, amused, etc. Then I try to create sensory experiences\u2014exposing them to heat, cold, smells, tastes, etc. The more the hypnosis can infiltrate their brain, the more effective it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your end goal with this session?\u201d Adam asked.\n\nI smiled. \u201cWe have five senses, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Sight, smell, touch, taste, and\u2026 what\u2019s the last one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHearing,\u201d I answered.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\u201cBut a lot of our brain is unused, right?\u201d I posed.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what if we *can* experience other senses, but don\u2019t know how to activate them?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike in the same sense that birds or whales know how and when to migrate. Or how any number of animals and insects can locate food or water in almost any scenario. They have these intuitions that we don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think these sessions can activate those extra senses?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to activate them in the real world, necessarily, but I do believe that we can activate them within the hypnosis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of senses?\u201d\n\nI took another sip of my whiskey. \u201cIt\u2019s still a theory, but I think we can tune our inner antenna, so to speak, to understand the secrets of the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike if we\u2019re alone in the universe. Like how all this came to be. Like what happens to the souls who have passed,\u201d I said.\n\nAdam sat in contemplation for a moment then smiled. \u201cDamn, well let\u2019s hope Bradford can bring us home,\u201d he said.\n\nI tipped my glass to him, sipped my whiskey, then took my place at the front of the room. Bradford hadn\u2019t moved an inch.\n\n\u201cAs you descend the stairs, you begin to hear voices calling from above. You hear your dad, your siblings, your friends. They all voice their support. *You can do it! Keep going! You\u2019re almost there! Be brave!\u201d*\n\nBradford sat up tall in his chair. *Getting closer,* I thought.\n\n\u201cThe flaming basketball finally finds an end to the staircase. You step onto a cobblestone landing and look around you. You have descended into a large silo of some kind\u2014maybe a cave or a well\u2014with nothing but a door of similar size and configuration as the first two against the wall. On the ground, a flicker of light reveals the location of the cage keys wedged between two stones. However, before you pick the keys up, you realize that you must first open the door.\n\n\u201cJust then someone descends the stairs behind you, but you don\u2019t feel scared. The person steps into the light of the flaming basketball and you realize that it\u2019s you. You are standing face to face with yourself. He smiles at you and you smile back.\u201d\n\nBradford smiled and I looked to Adam, he gave me a thumbs up.\n\n\u201cThe other you puts his hand on your shoulder and looks into your eyes. He\u2019s almost like a more self-assured version of yourself. He\u2019s fearless. He\u2019s brave. He\u2019s a hero. \u2018You must understand,\u2019 he says. \u2018You have been endowed for this mission. You were chosen long ago for this mission. Behind this door lies a cloud of knowledge. When you open the door and step inside, you will be immersed in this cloud. You will be met with a deep understanding of the mysteries of the universe. You will see the origins of creation. You will understand the immensity of all that exists. You will know these things and understand them in a way that will allow you to communicate your findings to others in the real world.\u2019\u201d\n\nI took a deep breath and looked over to Adam again for approval. He nodded, a look of utter anticipation on his face. \u201cDo it,\u201d he mouthed.\n\n\u201cThe other you stands aside and disappears, leaving nothing between you and the door. You understand what you must do. You take three steps forward, place one hand on the cold metallic door and apply pressure. As you do so, you feel something trickling down your upper lip. You stop pushing and wipe your nose. You are bleeding.\u201d\n\nAdam and I watched Bradford carefully for about fifteen seconds before he gently wiped his nose. He motioned his head to look down at his hand and opened his mouth in surprise. There was blood\u2014actual blood\u2014on his hands.\n\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Adam whispered to me.\n\nFrankly, I was more shocked than he was. Bradford was my first completely immersed patient. He was in my complete control. This was not an empowering thought, mind you, it was a horrifying one. I briefly considered pulling the plug on the whole thing right then\u2014guiding him away from the door and back up the staircase to the real world, but I didn\u2019t. \n\nGoddamn Lovecraft.\n\nI swallowed hard and held my bell steady.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to count to three and ring the bell. When you hear the bell, you will push open the door and become immersed in the cloud. After a few moments in the cloud, I will ring the bell and you will exit the cloud and close the door behind you.\u201d\n\nI repeated the instructions then took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d I mouthed to Adam. He nodded.\n\n\u201cOne\u2026 Two\u2026 Three\u2026\u201d I said, then dinged the bell.\n\nBradford jolted, flailing his arms and grunting. His chair rocked violently. I instructed Adam to steady it, so he didn\u2019t tumble off. How responsible of me.\n\nThe jolting stopped after a minute and Bradford sat still. Both his nostrils were bleeding now.\n\n\u201cNow, when I ring the bell again, you will exit the room and close the door behind you. One\u2026 Two\u2026\u201d\n\nBradford stood up abruptly, sending the chair and Adam sprawling onto the floor behind him. He ripped his blindfold off and looked around frantically, like a trapped animal.\n\n\u201cBradford, it\u2019s all okay,\u201d I said, but I knew it wasn\u2019t. \n\nHe didn\u2019t wake up on his own volition. Nor was there an external stimulus to wake him up\u2014my bell, or a loud noise like the thunder before. Something *inside* of the hypnosis woke him up.\n\nAdam stumbled to his feet. \u201cBradford, it\u2019s alright buddy. It\u2019s me, Adam, right here,\u201d he said and reached for him.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him. Come here,\u201d I told him. Adam obeyed and stood next to me against the wall.\n\nBradford looked around anxiously for another minute, his feet unmoving, then fixed his eyes on the concrete block wall on the opposite side of the room. \n\n\u201cStay here,\u201d I said to Adam. I walked to the other side of the room, between Bradford and the wall, the bell clutched in my hand. Frankly, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I had to assume he was still under some kind of hypnosis, though I didn\u2019t know *whose.*\n\n\u201cBradford, when I count to three and ring the bell, you will come out of hypnosis. Again, when I count to three and ring the bell, you will come out of hypn\u2014\u201d\n\nHe bolted straight at me, knocking me to the side and plowing straight into the wall, headfirst.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d I yelled, stumbling back to my feet. Adam ran over. \n\nBetween the two of us, we held Bradford down. He had a large gash on his head and a steady stream of blood pouring down his face, but he didn\u2019t *seem* to be in pain.\n\n\u201cBradford, listen to me,\u201d I said.\n\nHe turned his head toward me, revealing jittering pupils, as if there was an earthquake behind those eyes. \n\nAdam was crying. His phone buzzed across the room, diverting our attention for a moment. \u201cDo we call the cops?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, call 911,\u201d I said, trying incoherently to piece together a story in my head.\n\nOnce Adam got to his phone on the other side of the room, Bradford began seizing, knocking me on my ass. I backed up, recognizing my feeble body to be no match for his apparent raw animal strength.\n\n\u201cPlease, Bradford, breathe with me,\u201d I said.\n\nHe again eyed the block wall and ran at it with full force, his skull crunching on impact. Blood spattered on the wall and the floor. He fell onto the ground with a hollow thud.\n\nAdam screamed.\n\nI tried to lay Bradford\u2019s lifeless body straight when his eyes shot open, a look of pure terror on his face. \u201cNo!\u201d he screamed and rolled away from me. He got onto his hands and knees, breathing heavy. \n\nAs I carefully eased toward him, he let out a loud grunt and began hitting his head on the concrete floor with inhuman intensity. The sound of his head repeatedly crunching against the floor like that will haunt me forever. Blood continued to pool beneath him.\n\nI backed away from him, helpless.\n\nAdam screamed in horror.\n\nAfter five or six hard hits, Bradford finally collapsed onto the ground, splashing in his own blood.\n\nTears were streaming down my face. Adam was sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nA few moments passed in bone-chilling silence.\n\n\u201cDid you call anyone?\u201d I asked with a shaky voice.\n\nAdam stared unblinking at Bradford\u2019s mangled head resting on the ground.\n\n\u201cAdam?\u201d\n\nHe snapped out of it. \u201cUh, no, I\u2014\u201d he said, swiping through his phone. \n\n\u201cOkay\u2014the story\u2014our story\u2014\u201d I started.\n\nThen Adam\u2019s eyes grew wide.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe others. Trey and Bryson,\u201d Adam said, staring at his phone with his hand covering his mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhen they got to Bradford\u2019s house, they found Bradford\u2019s mom on the kitchen floor,\u201d he said and looked up at me. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hypnosis. It has to be,\u201d Adam said.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible, the hypnosis can\u2019t control someone who isn\u2019t under hypnosis,\u201d I said, nervously. \u201cIt can\u2019t be related. No way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that the goal is to tap into other senses, right? To activate other parts of the brain?\u201d Adam said.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s a theory, but either way, how would that kill Bradford\u2019s mom?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The only thing I can think of, is that, clearly Bradford was all-in. I mean, you hypnotized him into a bloody nose, didn\u2019t you? Maybe when you put our moms in a cage on the beach\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said and slipped his phone into his pocket. \u201cWhich\u2014oh shit\u2014I need to check on my mom,\u201d he said and darted up the basement stairs.\n\nNow I sit here in my cold, mildewy basement with this dead boy\u2019s body, penning my final haunting confession.\n\nFor the record, I want to apologize to Bradford\u2019s family. I take full responsibility for his death. And in the case that I am the cause of Bradford\u2019s mother\u2019s death, I apologize for that, too. I don\u2019t really want to think through the scientific implications if that *is* the case, to be honest.\n\nAll I know is that whether I spend my days as a free man or behind bars, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be able to sleep again wondering what Bradford saw when he opened that door and stepped into the cloud.\n\nSomething he saw drove him to this madness. That much is clear.\n\nI hear the police sirens outside now.\n\nOne last note to the psychiatric community or those who may be looking to build upon my research: Some things are better left [unknown.](https://www.derekwalker.me)", "How bad is it?

Those older posts have all the details but I will attempt to summarize. Also I just wanted to say that I really wanted to make the title \"$1000K the boring way\" but didn't have enough confidence.\n\n#Summary\n\nReached $1M net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in roughly 11 years, mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.\n\n#Quick^(ish) Recap\n\nMy wife and I are both 34 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I\u2019m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.\n\nOn our journey to $500k net worth we:\n\n- Both got graduate degrees.\n- Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.\n- Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $126k for me and $54k to $90k back down to $70k (part time) for my wife.\n- Bought a house and refi'd it twice.\n- Received $18k of student loan forgiveness.\n- Had two babies.\n\n#Updates\n\nIt's been a while since my last post - it was definitely weird going back and reading through these previous snapshots of our life. The $500k update was posted in Dec 2020 and even though the pandy had been going on for a bit, (as we all know) we were in for a much longer ride than anticipated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2021:** I think it's telling that I had a lot of trouble trying to remember things that happened this year. I hate to call it a lost year because I'm extremely grateful for the extra time I got to spend with my young kids - we really just didn't do much due to having said young kids and an abundance of caution. I went through my phone photo highlights from 2021 to try and jog my memory and they all were geotagged at our house or a nearby town. \n\nI actually found this pretty interesting from a financial perspective - on one hand, sure, there were less opportunities for spending on things like restaurants and social activities, and in the comments of my last update I had noted that our cash had built up really quickly basically on accident. On the other hand, the unknowns and challenges surrounding the pandemic and parenting really shifted my mindset around spending. I found it much easier to justify all types of purchases and spending because \"well, whatever it takes to get us through this\". I wouldn't say we went overboard or anything like that, more like we accepted a healthy amount of lifestyle creep into our lives. We bought the ridiculous inflatable kiddie pool (no it didn't last long), we started adding more \"fun\" stuff to our cart at the grocery, paid for little subscription services here and there, etc. For my own mental health, I basically completely stopped tracking spending, stocks, our accounts, bills, and most things finance-related (including this sub^(I'm so sorry)). Ultimately I think doing less during the pandemic plus our increased spending was more or less a wash financially.\n\nAt work, I officially maxed out on my salary band, so effectively I didn't get a raise. I'm pretty sure the COLA was also nonexistent this year which they blamed on Covid. I got to work 100% remote with no pressure to bring people back, which I really appreciated. With working a bunch of on-call nights and weekends I ended up at $136k for the year. My wife completed her first full year of part-time work which dropped her from $90k to $60k\n\nWe did end up buying a new car shortly after my last post in Dec 2020. Went with a Subaru Ascent (sorry to all the minivan fans from the previous comment section) and it turned out to be really lucky timing because we got it for insanely cheap and 0% interest and then the car market went crazy. \n\nOur youngest joined our oldest at daycare in the fall for a total of $2,150/mo. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2022:** At my job, I was feeling kind of stuck. At this point I had found that some side projects that I took on for \"fun\" (I did have a genuine interest/passion) had become basically additional full-time positions. I was getting a ton of recognition and accolades for the work I was doing, but no promotion or raise. The culture at my workplace was to protect/gatekeep the top engineering title at all costs, so my successes were constantly met with \"you're doing great, just be patient\" or \"the optics might not look good to the other engineering departments\" or various other BS. Ultimately, it made me start to resent my job that I really loved. I let my supervisor know early in the year that my patience was running low and eventually I would be forced to look elsewhere, which he understood.\n\nOn one frustrating day in the fall I decided to just have a quick look at the other similar companies in my area and happened upon a job posting that was kind of my dream role (essentially getting to do some of the extra work I had taken on as my full time job and drop the day-to-day stuff). It all happened very quickly after that: I got a call the morning after submitting my resume, then a week later I got a job offer 20 minutes after my interview had concluded. I asked for as much time to decide as possible, gave the offer to my current employer, and they made me wait a long time before coming back and saying they wanted to but couldn't match right now. So I left \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af There's a ton more to say on this topic but probably too much for this post as it is so happy to continue down in the comments if people want. The CEO ended up requesting to do a personal exit interview with me, so that was cool.\n\nOtherwise, 2022 was pretty uneventful financially. Obviously the market was down so not a lot of action or visible progress in our net worth journey. Was one of the first \"extended\" downturn-type period of time I've experienced in the market. I didn't change anything.\n\nWe took a much needed family vacay south of the border. Daycare raised prices by a reasonable 5% to $2,250/mo.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2023:** I started my new job in late Jan, going from $135k total comp to $160k plus a $12k signing bonus and I no longer have to be on-call overnight. I *heavily* engineered my start date to make sure I was still able to receive a one-time payout my old employer did at the beginning of the year to make up for freezing the salary schedule during Covid. I also had something ridiculous like 700 hours of PTO paid out (RIP my taxes this year). \n>Side note: I do not recommend saving up as much PTO as I did, go live your life. I was saving aggressively to prep for us having kids, and then the pandemic happened so barely used any for a couple years. Happy accident that my banked PTO ended up getting much more valueable over the years as my salary was increasing rapidly.\n\nOur house is great but as the kids are growing we are thinking it would be nice to have some extra space. We've talked to our realtor and lender to get the process moving but not in any specific rush. We will have to do some upgrades to the house like exterior paint, possibly the roof, deck upgrade (finished ourselves) but those are needed either way so just going to do them in case we decide to enter the market. The idea of getting a new mortgage right now seems so wild to me, but I know you can't time these things. It definitely would hurt to go from 2.875% to 7%. I'm considering exploring just adding on to our current house, but not sure if that's really feasible at this point.\n\nDaycare is now $2,900/mo lol (this is even with our costs going down slightly as our son has aged into the older classroom). It was actually hilarious to me that they sent out a \"We won best daycare in the region\" announcement followed very shortly by a 30% price increase. It is what it is though - I think this is pretty solidly reasonable for the area.\n\nWe took a family trip to Disneyland a couple days before our son turned 3 so that his park entry would still be free. My mindset going into trip planning was \"Disney is expensive, so if you want to go, just accept that\". We used a few different little tips and tricks for saving money here and there but overall tried not to worry too much about complete optimization. With that attitude we had a great trip and to me at least the memories and moments with my kids were totally worth it. Do the princess breakfast.\n\n#Chart\n\n[Here is our entire financial journey summed up in one line.](https://imgur.com/a/2MqEcTG) Apparently they don't do the thing anymore where it changes color when crossing over from negative to positive, that's a bummer (the first line on the y-axis is $0, not the x-axis). I really thought it would look like more of an exponential curve by now. There aren't really inflection points anymore besides the Covid 2020 drop, when the app would get confused, or accounts would stop updating from time to time, so here are the relevant dates in list form:\n\n- 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.\n- 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!\n- 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.\n- 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.\n- 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.\n- 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.\n- 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.\n- 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.\n- 4/7/21 crossed $700k net worth.\n- 8/27/21 crossed $800k net worth.\n- 3/26/22 crossed $900k net worth.\n- 5/1/23 crossed **$1M** net worth.\n\nI enjoyed watching the time between milestones get shorter and shorter, and then 2022 happened.\n\n#Current Finances\n\n- $100k in cash as an e-fund/new house downpayment savings, $6k in an HSA.\n- $550k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.\n- $370k equity in our home\n- -$10k of student loans remaining\n\nOur savings rate was 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies. Now? I have absolutely no idea. Past me and part of current me thinks that's both hilarious and terrifying - who even am I?? I believe it's likely around the 40% mark still. I think part of me doesn't want to figure it out because it might be lower than I was hoping for and stress me out unnecessarily. \n\n#Now what\n\nI told my wife the news that we were officially millionaires (that sounds so stupid typing it out) a few days ago and she asked \"what does that mean\". I said \"literally nothing, lol\". We are definitively in the \"boring middle\" phase of retirement savings, and so I don't expect any substantial changes. \n\nWhen is enough, enough? I really don't know. I still want to retire early, but as I've grown into my career (and very much^(mostly) enjoyed the work) I've found myself less eager to leave. I think working from home has had a huge impact on this. It's probably time for a sit down with my wife to talk about our next 5-10 years and maybe map out a number that we would feel comfortable with. \n\nIt's for sure time to update the budget soon and get that back on track. My oldest will attend kindergarten in the fall, so that will be nice to cut our daycare bill in half. We may never see that money if it ends up going towards a larger mortgage, but I need to get an updated picture of our finances before we can figure out exactly what sort of house we want to afford.\n\nOur student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. I find it kind of funny that despite all of our financial accomplishments, we still have not officially paid off our student loans. I'm holding out hope for the student loan bill to go through, so until there is interest being charged again, the last $10k will just sit there.\n\nNot that I think anyone would remember this, but if you read the last post you know I was planning on making a will and getting some life insurance. It's been 2.5 years and I've made zero progress on those fronts, which I realize is terrible and I really need to get on that. Likewise, I still don't have a specific plan for the kids' college beyond \"let's just generically save money and we will cash flow college or figure it out\".\n\nFor my career, I've got one last level to go as an individual contributor in my field. If I stay at my new company, I'm probably a couple years out from achieving it, but I could probably get it as soon as the end of this year if I go back to my old job. That would allow me to end my career in the $200k range which I think is a solid goal.\n\n#The *End* End\n\nIs this my last update ever? Maybe, who knows. Maybe a retirement update is in order many years down the road, but really I don't expect our path to there have anything new or interesting that I haven't already covered (wasn't that the whole point of this series of updates?). \n\nLooking back on this, I like to think that I successfully made our journey to being millionaires as boring as possible. I was inspired at a young age to learn that the possibility of retiring early could be simple and didn't take an overwhelming amount of skill or knowledge. You just had to be as consistent as possible. I'm not to retirement yet, but I believe in the path we are on and I'm hoping someone will find similar inspiration by me just showing the receipts. \n\nFinally, I want to sincerely thank everyone for reading and commenting over the years. As a loooooong time lurker on this sub I was so nervous for my first ever post and the responses I've received since then have been so uplifting and personally motivating. It means a lot.

I said a lot about it in yesterday's post, but Bunny Girl Senpai's Fukashigi No Carte is my unskippable ED. Not only is it so emotionally strong, but the walking scene just works. It's a really great touch how for every single girl the time of day is different, and how they each have that one thing in their life that they depend on that keeps them going (For Mai it's Sakuta, for Nodoka it's Mai, etc.) Something about it hits different, and it makes this anime a bittersweet one once you realize there are no more episodes left.\n\nRe:Zero may have some of the best collection of EDs in any anime I've seen. Memento, Stay Alive, and Believe In You are some of the sweetest and saddest songs you can listen to within the context of the show. Styx Helix, however, just hits on a whole other level. It's the first ED, and the animation is great, but the way the song plays after the episode and DURING certain scenes makes it so much more emotionally impactful. And the ED is a BANGER. It is so melancholic but also sounds like the ending of a chapter in a story. The cherry on top is when it shows Subaru and Emilia dying, just their hands, and Subaru grabs Emilia's hand. Before they die, Emilia slowly closes her fingers around Subaru's hand and they both die, the screen fading to white and the ending hand grabbing the screen. That part still makes me cry. It shows how Subaru and Emilia care about each other so much, and it honestly made me enjoy the anime this much more.\n\nFinally we have Naruto's Wind.

No visible damage in either car.", "I can\u2019t stand the arguments people make to defend/justify owning a massive SUV or pickup truck Anyone think these people are completely brainwashed?? Because with just about every argument they make the exact opposite is true. \n\nExamples:\n\n\u201cOh it makes me feel safe!\u201d\n\n- Massive vehicles are not safe for anyone. Not the drivers, not the cars around them, and certainly not pedestrians. The high center of gravity combined with high ground clearance and soft suspension on such a heavy vehicle is disasterous for handling. Such a simple maneuver such as swerving to avoid a collision that a lighter, lower car would handle just fine causes these SUVs to rollover or oversteer constantly. There\u2019s clips all over the internet showcasing this. They also stop slower and accelerate slower and quick maneuvers like what was mentioned above easily upset them and create dangerous situations. \n\n- The massive weight of the vehicle is terrible for crash compatability. The safety features of a small, lightweight economical sedan are not and will probably never be good enough to protect the occupants when being plowed into by a car that weighs 3 times as much. \n\n- Massive vehicles go through wear components much faster than smaller cars. I work as an auto technician and have lost count of massive 3 row SUVs I\u2019ve seen with 20 thousand miles on them that have no tread life left and the brakes look like they\u2019ve had 3 times the miles put on them. This isn\u2019t dangerous by itself per se but the average car owner is horrible about maintaining their vehicle and expects their giant SUV to have the same cost of ownership as something a 1/3rd of the size, so neglected maintenance is much more common compared to cars. \n\n- We\u2019ve seen a massive increase in pedestrian fatalities since SUVs/Light trucks became the dominant vehicles on the road. Because the high bumper height combined with the weight directs all of the energy of the impact into the person\u2019s chest, instead of their legs and lower extremities. SUV owners are also much more likely to jump the curb and drive in pedestrian areas to get around traffic, because they\u2019re impatient and think they own the road.\n\nBottom line, these vehicles are not safe for anyone. Period. \n\n\n\u201cI just really need the space!\u201d\n\n- It\u2019s been proven time and time again that smaller vehicles which were developed in the 80s/90s had more carrying capacity. A Volvo station wagon from that time period has more carrying capacity than modern SUVs that are twice the size. \n\n- Its also been proven that pickup truck owners use the bed for carrying something you would need a bed for (cannot be carried in the cab) a handful of times if not once per year. This is reflected in how pickup truck design has progressed. Beds have gotten much smaller, cabs have gotten much larger. Anyone that needs a pickup truck for pickup truck purposes are buying older ones that actually have bed space. The rest of them are just out there so midlife crisis white dudes can feel better about themselves. \n\n\u201cI really need to tow stuff!\u201d\n\n- again, research has shown that these vehicles are being used for towing once or less per year. There\u2019s really nothing else to say about this\n\n- it\u2019s worth mentioning as well that businesses and situations where someone actually needs a vehicle to tow something, they are buying older vehicles with much better towing capability. At the shop I work for we are always putting transmissions in newer vehicles are that are rated for towing. I don\u2019t care what the manufacturer says. Modern vehicles save for a very select few are not built for towing. If you try to tow in your Subaru Outback with your CVT you will destroy the transmission. I see it all the time. \n\nThe reality is that nothing about the needs of the American driving public have changed in the last 40 or 50 years. You have the vast majority of people who are just commuting or dropping their kids off at school, and a select few who need a vehicle for a specific purpose and are buying ones that can handle being used for that purpose. \n\nThe difference is that now people are being upsold into vehicles they don\u2019t need that can\u2019t even do what they think they can (keep them safe, tow, carry a lot of stuff etc) because manufacturers are actively skirting emissions regulations by making vehicles bigger. That\u2019s it. \n\nFuck cars in general, but especially fuck SUVs. They are incredibly anti-consumer and push people who don\u2019t even want one into buying one because of how much they mess with crash compatibility and visibility. People in smaller cars cannot see around these stupid things and are always getting merged into by them because they\u2019re a blindspot on wheels. Something needs to change.", "Highly recommend.

A teenage dream has died. Background:\n\nThe first Fast and the Furious movie came out when I was about 15. That movie captured my imagination.

Now that I'm 32, my attitude is just enjoy you car mostly stock and save up for that Porsche or Ferrari.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have gotten a 2003 WRX when I was 16 years old. I kept that car until 2017. That's 14 years. I enjoyed the car the most when it had just an uppipe and turboback exhaust. But two experiences going further taught me that heavy modding just isn't for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoilovers:\n\nThe first was adding a set of highly custom coilovers made by ZZYZZX motorsports back in 2004. I was into autocross at the time, and I wanted a car that handled awesomely. The trouble was the insane amount of adjustability with coilovers was actually a bad thing. Each shock had a rebound, bound, and a spring pre-load setting. Playing with these settings along with swaybar settings and tire pressures just took the pleasure away from the pure sensation of driving. Settings were always something in the back of my mind. How could this be better? Let me try just one more thing. In autocross, it took my focus away from the course. I could have gone faster by tweaking my racing technique. Instead, I was distracted by tweaking my suspension. I eventually sold the suspension and went back to stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCustom engine build:\n\nThe second experience was when my engine blew after 77,000 miles back in 2013. It was likely due to oil starvation from a failed oil pickup. I think this is a common problem. An old friend from the local Subaru community had started a shop and had gone full time into working on Subarus. He was big deal in the region by then. I was excited by the prospect of having something built by him, so I went for it. He suggested going for a 2.5 hybrid build. That is taking the 2.0 WRX heads and machining them to work with the STI 2.5 bottom end. I knew I didn't enjoy tweaking at this point. And I didn't want to make an ton of power. I actually kept the stock WRX TD04 turbo. I asked and hoped for a setup that was just set it and forget. I definitely did not get this.\n\nLong story short. I ended up blowing the motor. It could have been a bad batch of E85. It could have been something in the tune. Just not sure. One thing for sure, I could have been smarter about backing off when I noticed something was off. Ah, hindsight.\n\nI had the motor rebuilt with some upgrades like forged pistons and had it up and running again. But it was never the same. I always had the fear of blowing the motor again. I could never bounce it off the redline like I used to when it was mostly stock. There was always the worry of whether the car was trustworthy or not. After the engine blew the first time, I really took it on myself to be actively involved in the tune. I went into the maps and looked at tons of parameters, and I did plenty of logging. It's not what I wanted to do. I wanted a car I didn't have to think about. I was thinking a lot about the car at this point.\n\nI saw the car was pulling timing. This was because the factory knock sensor is calibrated to the 2.0 block and not the 2.5. Readjusting the sensitivity requires the Accessport. The opensource Tractrix-cable setup can't do it. Ugh. I had to discover this myself through the forums. No one else let me know. Not to mention, I spend a good amount of time dealing with hesitation and poor tip-in enrichment settings all throughout this. All of this had to be tweaked multiple times with my tuner's help. It got better over time. And having the injectors cleaned professionally helped. But it was never 100% perfect.\n\nIn addition, the car just wasn't satisfying on E85 with the stock turbo. The small turbo ran out of steam quickly and felt unsatisfying after mid-range. Any larger turbo with E85 likely meant bye bye transmission. An STI transmission swap runs about $6k-8k. I didn't know this was the only viable option before. In addition, the car's power didn't feel right with the factory suspension at all. How could it? Overall, I just didn't have the motive to continue the project. It also felt financially stupid. After putting $14k into all this engine work and driving 10k miles, I sold the car for $8.5k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nI write this all up, because I want to share my experiences with others. I want to let other people know what's involved with doing anything highly custom to a car. It will never be set it and forget it. There will always be something that you have to tweak and play with. It will take up a lot of your attention. And you will in the end have to rely on yourself to sort it out right. Shops and tuners will not get it perfect for you. You will have to push them. And you will be responsible when things break. So you will have to carry the burden of getting things right. And all of that has an impact on you driving enjoyment.\n\nI have since encountered many WRX's with far far more modifications going on sale for less than mine. Many STI's with fully built blocks going on sale with less than 10k miles on them. My hunch is that many owners have fallen into the same situation and are just not happy with what they have. Or they have had to deal with endless delays at their shop or failed engines. It's all very common it seems.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uceYB9GA13M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uceYB9GA13M)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/80n9x8/those\\_that\\_have\\_extensively\\_modified\\_cars\\_was\\_it/?utm\\_content=title&utm\\_medium=user&utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_name=u\\_faceplate](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/80n9x8/those_that_have_extensively_modified_cars_was_it/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=u_faceplate)\n\nAll of this anecdotally makes me believe that stock blocks are more reliable than custom built engines even when pushed harder. The are just too many variables with a custom built block. It's hard to put something together better than the factory. My hunch is that a custom block will make more power now, but in the long run it will fail. I'd rather have a stock block pushed to 125% than a built block running at 80%.\n\nSo from now on, I think I will stick to just adding an exhaust on any future car I buy. I might do an ECU flash if it is very conservative and I can test it on the dyno. But that's about it. It's a shame because I always dreamed of owning cars like a Supra or Skyline R32 or a high-revving Honda. I always dreamed about those beautiful engine bays. But all the stress and hassle and money just doesn't seem worth it to me anymore.\n\nMy experiences almost killed my love for cars. Luckily, they didn't. I've been driving a Legacy, and I'm thinking of buying an FR-S next. I've read about people who have spent and struggled far more than I have. And think it just goes to show how much we love these machines even when they make us suffer. For me it was my love for an old car and my wanting to have something built by an old friend.\n\nI am most curious about your thoughts.\n\n[https://slyfstyle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/7792322370\\_ea24ea9d14\\_b.jpg](https://slyfstyle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/7792322370_ea24ea9d14_b.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nMy experience has lead me to believe that modifying a car upsets its natural balance. Returning this balance requires a huge amount of time spent tweaking. In addition, it requires far more money than originally anticipated. On top of all of this, it requires that the owner to be constantly paying attention to how the car is functioning because only they are responsible when something goes wrong. This added attention required to constantly tweak the car to get it to run the way you want combined with the worry of something going wrong leads to an unenjoyable driving experience when compared to a relatively stock car.\n\n&#x200B;", "22 Impreza saved me and my gf.

It may be minor edits or major additions that have plot importance for when the Second Season airs.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Strawpoll: [Who was your favourite character this episode?](https://strawpoll.com/d4z2s2es)\n\n---\n\n### Various Links:\n\n#### [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)\n\n### Crunchyroll Streams: \n\n####[**Director's Cut - Episode 10**](https://www.crunchyroll.com/rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-/episode-10-from-zero-battle-against-the-white-whale-793680)\n\n####[**English Dub - Episode 18**](https://www.crunchyroll.com/rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-/episode-18-from-zero-783484) [**& 19**](https://www.crunchyroll.com/rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-/episode-19-battle-against-the-white-whale-783486)\n\n---\n\n### Regarding Spoilers\n \nThis is going to be a rewatch for many people, but also a first time experience for some users. Because of that, **please keep any future episode spoilers within the subreddit's spoiler tag feature.** View the sidebar to see how they work.\n \nAdditionally, I would like to ask that spoilers be limited to the **anime adaption only**. Anything past that, including the Light Novel or Web Novel, is ***absolutely not permitted*** during this Re:Watch.\n\nWith the rebroadcast including new scenes/ content not present in the original release, please avoid discussing what the new material will be until it is shown.\n \nKeep in mind: ***No one likes being spoiled.***\n\n---\n\n### New Content/ Changes:\n\n* TBD\n\n---\n\n### Notices: \n\n- You have probably all heard the news by now, but due to the impact of the Coronavirus across the world, **Re:Zero's Second Season is being rescheduled to start in the Summer season**.\n\n- Now this certainly is not the best of news as a fan of the series (the point of this rewatch was to lead directly in to it), however the priority here should be the safety of the people involved behind the scenes on these productions.\n\n- Some benefits from this include more production time to ensure the show looks the best it can. This also opens up some time before the Second Season starts to watch the new **Bond of Ice** OVA which will be releasing soon.\n\n- There is not much else I can do here regarding this, I just hope both new and returning watchers are enjoying the rewatch in general and continue to look forward to the new season.", "Repeatedly DEAD BATTERY issue FINALLY SOLVED Okay, officially 1 week removed from finding the final fix, and I feel confident posting this now for everyone.  \n\nPretext: if you\u2019ve experienced repetitive dead battery issues and been told by Subaru any/all of the following, this post is for you:\n\n> You need to drive it more often\n\n> Don\u2019t store your key fob within 80ft\n\n> Your battery is bad, you need to replace it\n\n> Get a battery tender \n\n> We tested it an everything is fine\n\n\nThere\u2019s 100% a parasitic drain on your battery, and with 99% certainty I can tell you EXACTLY what is causing it, even though apparently Subaru can\u2019t/won\u2019t. \n\nThe cheapest + best fix (~ $300) contains 3 parts:\n\n1- Remove your DCM fuse. It\u2019ll kill starlink, but impacts nothing else. 90% of the issue is parasitic drain from a faulty DCM. Replacement costs $800, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying for that just for an SOS button.  \n\n[Relevant link 1 | 2017 reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Subaru_Outback/comments/fzny5f/2017_outback_parasitic_battery_drain/)\n\n[Relevant link 2 | 4th comment down](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Discussion-t68630_ds1102368)\n\n2- Take it in to Subaru and have them perform the software update for your alternator after they confirm it is indeed the DCM causing the parasitic drain ($100 for parasitic drain test & alternator software update). It\u2019s complicated, but basically the alternator was programmed from the factory to NOT fully charge your battery in order to save gas. I\u2019m not kidding. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous. \n\n[Relevant a link 3 | scroll to very last comments at bottom](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Discussion-t58701_ds833514)\n\n3- Get a new battery ($150-$250), preferably a bigger/better one like we\u2019ve all heard helps.  The reason you\u2019re doing this too is starting fresh so you don\u2019t have lingering issues from a battery with a lowered capacity due to repetitive complete drains.", "Forbes Says If You Want To Make A Social Impact Buy A New Subaru Vehicle ", "2000 Subaru Outback. If I turn the wheel before backing, I hear a click, and steering wheel will be re-oriented as seen in the picture. This doesn\u2019t impact wheel alignment. I can drive around like this and car handles ok. Eventually returns to normal. Is this a safety issue? "]}
