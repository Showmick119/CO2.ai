# About the Project
st.header("üöÄ About the Project")
st.markdown("""
Sustainability is a key factor in the automotive industry as manufacturers transition to environmentally friendly technologies.
This dashboard helps track and analyze sustainability scores based on key metrics such as:
- **CO2 Emissions**: Real-world carbon emissions in grams per mile.
- **Fuel Economy (MPG)**: Efficiency in miles per gallon, including real-world Ton-MPG metrics.
- **Powertrain Type**: Gasoline, hybrid, and electric powertrains are considered.
- **Yearly Sustainability Trends**: Tracks the improvement or decline in sustainability over the years.

                This graph depicts the sustainability scores of major car manufacturers from 2008 to 2024, reflecting their progress 
                in emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and eco-friendly initiatives. A steady rise across most manufacturers 
                indicates growing efforts toward sustainability, with a significant post-2020 surge due to increased EV adoption and 
                stricter regulations. Leaders like BMW and Mercedes show rapid advancements, setting benchmarks for the industry. The upward 
                trends highlight the global automotive sector's commitment to addressing environmental concerns, showcasing its 
                transition toward greener practices and technologies.

                This tool analyzes car manufacturers' sustainability using publicly available data, including information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
                Scores reflect rigorous metrics, focusing on emissions, energy efficiency, and sustainability efforts. Tesla was excluded due to a lack of comparable 
                data, ensuring fairness and consistency in the analysis. This project aims to promote transparency and awareness, not to critique or target any 
                specific company.
