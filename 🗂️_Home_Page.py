# About the Project
st.header("üöÄ About the Project")
st.markdown("""
Sustainability is a key factor in the automotive industry as manufacturers transition to environmentally friendly technologies.
This dashboard helps track and analyze sustainability scores based on key metrics such as:
- **CO2 Emissions**: Real-world carbon emissions in grams per mile.
- **Fuel Economy (MPG)**: Efficiency in miles per gallon, including real-world Ton-MPG metrics.
- **Powertrain Type**: Gasoline, hybrid, and electric powertrains are considered.
- **Yearly Sustainability Trends**: Tracks the improvement or decline in sustainability over the years.

# Why Sustainability Scores Matter
st.header("üåç Why Are Sustainability Scores Important?")
st.markdown("""
Understanding and improving sustainability metrics in the automotive industry is vital for combating climate change. 
By focusing on reducing emissions and improving efficiency, manufacturers can:
- Comply with global environmental regulations.
- Enhance consumer trust and brand image.
- Contribute to a healthier planet for future generations.
